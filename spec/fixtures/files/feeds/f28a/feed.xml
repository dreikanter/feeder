that’s so difficult to control! And aaah the scales are so round ,
how did you do that? Many super tiny stiches? It looks like you put a
lot of love and time into this, I’m sure your friend was thrilled!
(*＾v＾*)
 Your art style makes him look so beautiful and dainty with his
pointy and elegant claw! Every dragon would be lucky to hold an
adorable claw like that  ₍՞◌′ᵕ‵ू◌₎♡&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for submitting, it’s really cute and made me very happy! Have a nice day! :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/post/160833469077</link><guid>http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/post/160833469077</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 11:24:55 +0200</pubDate><category>Submission</category><category>platinum-boomerang</category><category>AWESOME PEOPLE BEING AWESOME</category><category>I smell so hard like onions right now</category><category>I sort of poked my right ear to death with a qtip</category><category>again</category><category>and the local doctor is already closed</category><category>and on the internet it said put an onion on your ear and it will heal</category><category>now I have a hurt ear and smell like onions</category><category>I would recommend to not trust the internet on onion related health tips</category><category>trust your doctor</category><category>our village doctor is pretty cool he once did CPR on a dog</category><category>the dog still died but at least he tried I guess</category><category>remember those chestnuts I planted last winter? two of them are growing now!! c:</category><category>but yesterday when I checked on them they had vine fretters</category><category>I brushed them off but know the little trees are looking a little sad</category><category>I'm sorry trees</category><category>I wonder if they want some onions</category><category>but maybe this is just how baby trees look after rain?</category><category>I think I'll put the big one in a bigger pot</category><category>I wish school would teach us about caring for baby trees</category><category>and less latin</category><category>submission</category></item><item><title>Photo</title><description>&lt;img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/c393ca4129d9e160186e87a58065a17c/tumblr_opfp7a7fy01s5b5tzo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><link>http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/post/160340936572</link><guid>http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/post/160340936572</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2017 20:01:25 +0200</pubDate><category>harry potter</category><category>of course hermione had great hair in all books</category><category>but that yule ball scene was so important to me</category><category>I always imagined my prom to be like that</category><category>but then it wasn't because I accidently got the most poofy and sparkly dress on purpose</category><category>it even had poofy roses</category><category>and the hair dresser had tried to do something cool with loose strands of hair hanging out of the main hair</category><category>but I was so sweaty in that dress that those loose strands turned into sweat antennas in then minutes</category><category>glittery sweat antennas</category><category>I was grace</category><category>you know the hall we had our prom in is also the hall were our cities anime convention is held in every year</category><category>it's a good place</category><category>prom was really fun! c:</category><category>but I think there is a reason why mother never put up the pictures on the wall</category><category>the reason is poofy and sweaty</category></item><item><title>Photo</title><description>&lt;img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/736d7b6a0eb95797fc180b6ceb5e4d77/tumblr_opfnbcFdEk1s5b5tzo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><link>http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/post/160306187038</link><guid>http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/post/160306187038</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2017 20:02:10 +0200</pubDate><category>selfie bee</category><category>a quality post after a like 2 week long break</category><category>hello friends!! how are you? c:</category><category>the new semester has started and it's awesome</category><category>I'm taking a course about dogs</category><category>it turned out that I cannot actually like use the course but I love it too much to stop</category><category>yesterday there was a REAL dog in the class and it ate a pencil and then it made BLEBLEBLE</category><category>he is a good boy</category><category>and I finally went to the dentist after I forgot my appointmet!</category><category>the dentist said that I need to stop brushing my teeth so hard because I sort of brushed away my teeth flesh</category><category>I feel like teeth flesh is not the right vocabulary for it</category><category>sometimes things are so scary in english</category><category>I remember being in grade six and we read a text in our english textbook and it was a story about one kid watching her younger brother</category><category>and then the child says to the brother</category><category>'Brother!

know those terrible haribo gummy smurfs</category><category>our school had a kiosk that sold those</category><category>and it was run by middle schoolers</category><category>probably to teach us something about economis or something</category><category>but in reality we all just dreamed of the power to be in charge of 200 gummy smurfs</category><category>so one day I was a middle schooler and the day arrived our class would be running the kiosk</category><category>we were split into groups of 3 and every group then had 2 weeks of smurf duty</category><category>and it was intense</category><category>all the kids just stuck their arms into the kiosk window and screamed for smurfs</category><category>but the thing was that we had but the smurf bucket very close to the window</category><category>because we didn't really think this through</category><category>and one day we noticed we made too little money compared to the smurfs that were missing</category><category>and I got so scared</category><category>because I had been at the window that day and feared that I had given a kid a smurf without collecting money for it</category><category>and with the money we were supposed to go to a class trip</category><category>I put 2 Euro extra into the money jar to cover up for the crime but word got around and we had to have a class conference about this and</category><category>during the next break out group met up at the kiosk and that one kid Josie just said 'You know that i've been eating the smurfs right'</category><category>and another kid then said 'Yeah i've been eating the smurfs too'</category><category>turned out that everybody had been eating the smurfs</category><category>I wish I could tell you I stayed on the path of truthfulness but in the next break I ate a lollipop before the kiosk opened</category><category>at least it wasn't a smurf</category><category>and you know what two years later the kiosk was closed and turned into a shop that sold school shirts and stuff</category><category>crime ruins everything</category></item><item><title>Photo</title><description>&lt;img

sorry I am trash and bad at drawing byeee(&gt;^ω^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SO MANY DRAWINGS WHERE DO I START I LOVE THEM ALL ʕ •́؈•̀ ₎&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your submission! There are so many cool things! I really love your
take on the human dragon bros, in dragon form the two look pretty similar so it must have been
difficult to come up with something that is both creative and sitll
recognizable.  I think you found a great way to do it! With paying so
much attention to the details -  I really like how the dragons scales
are pattern on the shirt and how the scales twirl on Squadricks tail they still look very dragon-y  and characters very
recognizable. I also love that you weren’t afraid to make them look
different. I love Chestophers belly sticking out, how cute ♡´･ᴗ･`♡ Nancy and the bee also look super cool . The expressions are
100% spot on while still showing your own style. You have a knack for using very fitting body language for their facial expression. I hope having a knack means the thing I hope it means. I am trying to say that it looks good ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No drawing that you
enjoyed drawing is bad. It takes courage to post art on the internet
since it’s something always something personal, so please be proud
both of your art and your guts. Also your signature is super cute
never change it （*´▽｀*）&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for
showing it to me, I hope you have a nice day! C:
