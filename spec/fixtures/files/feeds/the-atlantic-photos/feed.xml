      <title>A Photo Trip Through Yellowstone National Park (30 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/5PMsxSsNGFk/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yellowstone National Park, now 145 years old, was the first national park established in the world. In 2016, the 2.2-million-acre park was visited by a record 4.2 million people, who came to experience the wilderness, explore countless geothermal features, witness the gorgeous vistas, and try to catch a glimpse of the resident wildlife. Gathered here are a handful of compelling photos from Yellowstone’s past, as well as some from recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Weekend of Protest in St. Louis (35 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/8x_kjOzQZ0g/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday, a judge in St. Louis found Jason Stockley, a white former St. Louis police officer, not guilty of first-degree murder in the death of a black man named Anthony Lamar Smith. Smith was shot and killed by Stockley after a high-speed chase in 2011. Throughout the weekend, groups of protesters took to the streets of St. Louis, voicing their anger with the decision. At night, as most of the peaceful demonstrators dispersed, others took their anger out on police cars and nearby businesses, smashing dozens of windows. More than 80 arrests were reported on Sunday alone.&lt;/p&gt;

Dozens of business windows were smashed and at least two police cars were damaged during a second day of protests following the acquittal of Stockley, who was charged with first-degree murder last year following the 2011 on-duty shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith.

      <title>Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2017 (13 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/o5N7q0PSoCA/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, founded in 1965, is an annual international showcase of the best in nature photography. Wildlife Photographer of the Year is developed and produced by the Natural History Museum, London. This year, the contest attracted nearly 50,000 entries from 92 countries. The owners and sponsors have once again been kind enough to share the following 13 finalists from this year's competition. Their &lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/wpy"&gt;website &lt;/a&gt;has images from previous years and more information about the current contest and exhibition. Captions are provided by the photographers and WPY organizers and lightly edited for style.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;b&gt;Winter pause&lt;/b&gt; - The red squirrel closed its eyes for just a moment, paws together, fur fluffed, then resumed its search for food. Winter is a tough time for northern animals. Some hibernate to escape its rigors, but not red squirrels. Andersson walks every day in the forest near his home in southern Sweden, often stopping to watch the squirrels foraging in the spruce trees. Though their mainly vegetarian diet is varied, their winter survival is linked to a good crop of spruce cones, and they favor woodland with conifers. They also store food to help see them through lean times. On this cold, February morning, the squirrel’s demeanor encapsulated the spirit of winter, captured by Andersson using the soft-light grain of black and white.

      <title>The Wreckage Left in Irma's Path Across the Caribbean and Southeastern United States (35 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/AzzLy16rZMM/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Days after Hurricane Irma wreaked havoc across the Caribbean and several U.S. states, government officials and residents are beginning to assess the widespread damage, pick up the pieces, and figure out their next steps. For some Caribbean islands, like Saint Martin, the destruction is nearly total, with evacuations underway as officials try to rebuild basic infrastructure. FEMA reports that 25 percent of all homes in the Florida Keys were destroyed, while 65 percent were significantly damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Hurricane Irma, now a tropical storm, moves out of Florida, images of the destruction left behind are beginning to appear. While the enormous storm caused widespread damage and flooding, and left more than &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/floridas-largest-utility-west-floridas-electrical-grid-will-need-a-wholesale-rebuild/539328/"&gt;10 million without power&lt;/a&gt;, most reports indicate that most of Florida appears to have dodged a worst-case-scenario. Residents are now beginning to return to assess the damage, and begin recovery and rebuilding efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hurricane Irma Crashes Across Northern Cuba (30 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/Zb_DR6xVZdk/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On September 8, Hurricane Irma made landfall on Cuba as a destructive Category 5 storm, slowly spinning along its northern coast for hours, before turning north toward Florida. The high winds tore roofs from buildings, uprooted trees, toppled power lines, and blocked roads across central and northern Cuba. Coastal towns and cities were swamped by storm surge waters, leaving parts of Havana submerged as Irma moved on. More than a million residents and tourists had been evacuated ahead of the storm, as a precaution. As of Sunday night, there were no storm-related deaths reported in Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Hurricane Irma appears set on a possible path toward southern Florida, the Category 5 storm has already left a trail of destruction across parts of the Caribbean. The worst-affected island so far is Saint Martin, which has reported eight deaths to date. The island of Saint Martin is split into two parts, overseen by the governments of France and the Netherlands. Reuters has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-irma-netherlands/dutch-prime-minister-enormous-devastation-on-saint-martin-idUSKCN1BI107"&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as saying that Irma has caused “enormous devastation,” and that the island remains unreachable for now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wildfires Rage Across the American West (33 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/JgNjprIwr6s/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dozens of forest and brush fires are currently burning across eight western states, forcing thousands to flee, destroying homes, and closing highways. Enormous volumes of smoke and ash are being thrown into the atmosphere as more than a million acres have burned in the past week alone, creating hazardous breathing conditions in many parts of the Pacific Northwest. In California, the La Tuna fire near Burbank has burned nearly 7,200 acres, becoming the largest fire ever recorded in Los Angeles in terms of area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thousands of Rohingya Muslims Flee Violence in Burma (28 photos)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Refugee Agency &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57459#.Wa7u1MiGMVM"&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that 123,000 people—mostly Rohingya Muslims—have fled into Bangladesh since August 25, escaping a new round of violence in Burma’s western Rakhine state. The refugees have walked for days, after a series of Rohingya insurgent attacks on Burmese police were met with a strong government response and the burning of thousands of homes. The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority living in parts of a hostile and overwhelmingly Buddhist Burma. U.N. officials say their relief camps are reaching full capacity as thousands of refugees continue to cross into Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each year, participants in the Burning Man Festival travel to the playa of Nevada’s Black Rock Desert to form a temporary city—a self-reliant community populated by performers, artists, free spirits, and more. An estimated 70,000 people from all over the world came to the 31st annual Burning Man to dance, express themselves, and take in the spectacle, themed this year as “Radical Ritual.” Gathered below are some of the sights from this year, photographed by Reuters photographers Jim Urquhart and Jim Bourg.&lt;/p&gt;

                Afghan policemen try to rescue four-year-old Ali Ahmad at the site of a suicide attack followed by a clash between Afghan forces and ISIS gunmen at a Shi'ite Muslim mosque in Kabul, Afghanistan, on August 25, 2017. The boy survived, and is now back with his family, but still suffers nightmares, his father said. Ali Ahmad was with his grandfather in the Imam Zaman mosque on Friday when at least two attackers in police uniforms stormed in, one exploding a suicide-bomb vest and the other firing indiscriminately at the hundreds of worshipers inside. His grandfather was among at least 20 killed. Sayed Bashir, Ali's father, was nearby but not in the mosque when the initial blast was heard and immediately ran to check on his family. "Right after the explosion I thought everything was finished," he said. "I called my father's mobile phone number and my son answered and said: 'They killed grandpa.' He wanted me to bring the car and get him. We were running everywhere in search of my son but the police were stopping us and didn't let us get too close." Bashir called the number again and was speaking to Ali when another explosion went off. "I lost hope. I said to myself that everything was finished. I tried the number again but it was switched off." In fact, Ali had run behind the mosque, disregarding the policeman frantically signalling to him in the courtyard.

      <title>Latest Photos of Harvey's Disastrous Flooding (31 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/vnwibYpscIg/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Less than a week ago, Hurricane Harvey made landfall, and in the days following, it dumped trillions of gallons of rain on parts of Texas and Louisiana, spawning unprecedented flooding. More than 13,000 rescues have been made so far, with more taking place as the storm and floodwaters shift to the east. With rainfall accumulation measured at 51.88 inches, Harvey set the record as the wettest tropical cyclone ever to hit the contiguous United States. Recovery, which is predicted to last months or years, has only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;

The neighborhood flooded after water was released from nearby Addicks Reservoir.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, in the Spanish Mediterranean town of Bunol, around 22,000 people gathered to throw 150 tons of ripe tomatoes at each other in the world's biggest annual tomato fight. &lt;em&gt;La Tomatina&lt;/em&gt; attracts tourists from around the world, especially Britain, Japan, and the United States. This year marks the 72nd anniversary of the messy fiesta.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the floodwater continues to rise in southeastern Texas, residents have been trying to reach safety for days now—many of them bringing along their beloved furry companions. The dogs and cats of displaced flood victims are being cared for by owners, neighbors, and first responders across the region, finding medical attention and safety in shelters, and remaining close to their owners.&lt;/p&gt;

Rising floodwaters have forced tens of thousands to flee, overburdening emergency services and filling shelters. So far, at least five deaths have been blamed on the storm. State and local authorities, as well as countless volunteers, have been working hard all weekend to rescue stranded residents and offer assistance to those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Harvey, the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in more than a decade, made landfall on the Texas coast late Friday as a Category 4 storm, destroying homes, overturning vehicles and sinking boats, severing power lines, and forcing tens of thousands of residents to flee. As Harvey, now downgraded to a tropical storm, lingers over Texas, record amounts of rain are predicted, which could spawn even more destruction in the form of catastrophic flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Over Georgia, Last Drone Photos Before Regulation (20 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/Ut6-bOKf53M/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the country of Georgia remained one of the last nations for drone pilots to fly in relatively unregulated skies. On September 1, Georgia will adopt European-style restrictions on drones, so photographer &lt;a href="http://www.amoschapplephoto.com/"&gt;Amos Chapple&lt;/a&gt;, working for Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, set out to make one last aerial photo tour before the new laws kicked in. Chapple said that most of the countryside shots would still be possible in the future, but the city photos would likely be forbidden. Be sure to see his &lt;a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/one-last-time-over-georgia/28681658.html"&gt;full story at Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inside the Dugway Proving Ground (15 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/okm-3440CzY/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;George Frey, Getty images photographer, recently had the opportunity to visit the U.S. Army’s Dugway Proving Ground, a sprawling top-secret military facility in the Utah desert that tests and develops methods of working with chemical, biological, radiological, and explosive hazards. Frey: “Workers at this facility handle some of the most deadly and dangerous biological and chemical agents on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;India celebrated its 70th Independence Day on August 15, during a busy week across the nation. Photojournalists in this vast and varied country covered monsoon flooding, widespread and varied protests, a deadly incident in a government hospital, Hindu festivals, unrest in Kashmir, Bollywood film sets, deadly landslides, and much more, with these photographs from just the past 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vigils, Marches, and Memorials After Charlottesville (22 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/BpscqNBf22c/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In squares and streets across the United States, vigils and marches were held this weekend in response to the hatred and violence on display during a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 12th. 32-year-old counter-protester Heather Heyer was killed when James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, also injuring 19 others. Gathered here are images of some of those who took to the streets to mourn, and to decry racism and hate, from Charlottesville to Chicago, Washington to Los Angeles, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>World Elephant Day (18 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/_mPMfGivWl4/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, August 12 has been set aside as World Elephant Day. Supported by numerous conservation agencies, it’s a day to “spread awareness, share knowledge, and provide solutions for better care and management of both captive and wild elephants,” according to the organizer’s &lt;a href="http://worldelephantday.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Elephants face numerous challenges, including poaching, habitat loss, exploitation, abuse, and proximity to human conflict and poverty. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists African elephants as “vulnerable” and Asian elephants as “endangered.” On this World Elephant Day, I present a collection of images of these amazing animals splashing, bathing, swimming, and enjoying the water.&lt;/p&gt;
