      "I’ll stop wearing black when they make a darker colour…\n\nThat’s a hilarious nod to Fall Out Boy, I promise. But hello friends! How are we all doing this weekend? I really can’t get my head back into the game with regularly posting on here; I wonder where I found the time before my hiatus. Between a full time job and staring at a kitten (yes, I’m still obsessed with my cat) I just can’t find the time these days… But let’s talk about some plus size alternative retro courtesy of Belle Poque!\n\nThis item was gifted in return for a review and images. Opinions are my own, I’m not paid to say anything in particular. Some links may be affiliate links, it just means I might get a few quid if you buy through my links. You can read more in my disclaimer.\n\nPlus size alternative retro? What even is that?\n\nMy style has changed dramatically since the before-covid times. I’m sure a lot of us have a similar experience — either we’re all in love with loungewear, we finally started dressing how we always wanted, or our bodies and attitudes to clothing changed. Mine’s a bit of the former, a bit of the latter. I want to look like a comfy goth mum with a vintage twist, is that so much to ask? I’m calling it alternative retro because it’s a bit grown-up-emo, a sprinkling of 50’s and 60’s styling and more than a few band shirts thrown in.\n\nBelle Poque – 40’s – 70s Vintage and Stylish Clothing\n\nSo Belle Poque was a place I’d never think to buy from, honestly. Whenever I’d see adverts or... (continued)"

      "Get loved up in style!\n\nWell hello friends and welcome back to the blog! Yes, I made a big deal about coming back and then took another month off… I’d make more of an apology about it, but I think the whole world understands the constant burn out. But I digress, because today I want to talk to you about some amazing SHEIN dresses and plus size date outfits!!\n\nBefore I get into this post, I want to make a quick point on something — I will not be facilitating any arguments about SHEIN today. Maybe in the future I’ll finally finish the post I want to make on being fat and the discourse on fast fashion brands. But, what I will say is this; when you’re plus sized, finding clothes is difficult and regularly unaffordable when it does exist. For me, having a brand that caters to my size and creates clothes that allow plus sized people to express themselves is important. Affiliate links are also in use. (Read more about those in the disclaimer)\n\nPlus Size Date Outfits!\n\nCoffee Date — Rib Knit Dress\n\nWhether it’s with your beau or your bestie, Coffee Dates are honestly my favourite! It lends itself to a bit more of a casual outfit, and this dress is perfect for the occasion! I actually ADORE this dress! Perfect knit weight, non-seethrough and keeps its shape perfectly. I wear it so often that I literally bought a second one because I never want to be without this dress.\n\nAlso comes in burgundy, light grey and a minty teal colour, for those of you that wear other colours...

      "Anyone else got ‘into the thick of it’ stuck in their head now?\n\nHappy Sunday, folks! How are we doing? Hopefully your first week of 2022 has been productive and/or just a good time! I started strong with a Big Clean in my flat, and ended up a bit broken by the end of the week and struggled with getting myself co-ordinated. The joys of a mental health struggle, really! But I digress, how about some handmade plus size style for you this week?\n\nSoooo these photos are actually from the end of November, and if I’m completely honest, I really didn’t like the photos. It’s been a while since I stood in front of a camera, and the photos show how rusty I was! Also how rusty The Fiancé® is with the camera, bless. I hadn’t taken photos of myself since mid October, and I can’t say I’m particularly happy with how I look. I mentioned briefly in my mental health post that I’ve been suffering from some hair loss in my fringe. These photos show the hair loss off pretty well, which sucks to look at, naturally. So I sat on the images for a while. It’s hard when your outer image doesn’t match what you think, and can be difficult to look at when there’s body changes you’re less than happy about. But I suppose this is all about true acceptance!\n\nHandmade Plus Size Style\n\nAside from my own bullshit about my body and hair loss, there was a point to this post, I promise! I made a thing! I had some time off in November and decided to force some creativity to help me out with the ol’... (continued)"

      "Happy New Year, darlings!\n\nIt’s the end of another year, and as I say every year — where the hell did it go? I feel like I blinked and August turned to Christmas Day. And now it’s the end of the year, and whilst people gear up to have a New Year’s Eve party or… whatever people do on NYE, I’m gearing up to consume garlic bread and bourbon and give a middle finger to Another Shitty Year. Here’s 2021 In Review, a little look at my year.\n\n2021 In Review\n\nCovid, Cancer and Mental Health Struggles\n\nLet’s start off with The Bad Stuff, huh? 21 months later from the first lockdowns and guess what; covid still rules the roost. It’s difficult to be completely positive about the year when you spent a lot of it inside and even more fearful of it than 2020. But vaccines are now available, and with them comes a little more freedom, I suppose.\n\nOf the worst things to hear in general, my mum was diagnosed with bladder cancer back in May. She’s a fighter and it was found quickly, though. She had a round of chemo and a long course of radiotherapy, and although we’re not fully out of the woods, she’s definitely doing better. Fingers crossed in the new year we get more concrete news and can move on from this, though! This is possibly the only part of my life I’m staying hopeful of, to be honest with you.\n\nMental health struggles? Yeah, we’ve spoken about that in the last post, didn’t we? It’s not been an easy year for my noggin, honestly. I’ve become pretty isolated through covid... (continued)"

      "Well. Um, hi!!\n\nIt’s been a hot minute, hasn’t it? My last post was in mid October and my last Instagram post was at the end of October. A time, indeed. It’s been an unexpected hiatus of blogging, and honestly? There’s been just no spark to actually do anything outside of existing the last two months. That’s the joys of mental health struggles, right?\n\nYay for random hair loss? My poor fringe is suffering\n\nHooray for the Mental Health Struggle\n\nBetween my regular depression, seasonal depression and pandemic depression, I’ve honestly been knocked off my feet in the emotions department. My life is literally sleep, eat, work, hang out with a kitten and play Animal Crossing. I barely speak to my friends, rarely leave the house for non-work related things, and generally am just bleak as fuck. The willpower to create content, make things or even just write has been MIA for a bit. However, I feel like I’m pulling through a bit, making a bit of a breakthrough and slowly crawling back to being myself.\n\nI’m not alone when I say that I’m still living in fear, that I’m still holding life to a stop until this ‘all blows over’ — if it ever will. But it’s also given me a lot of excuses to be the worst version of myself; one that has no social interaction, that has become agoraphobic and generally just a bit sucky. Of course, it’s all for the right reasons. I stay home to protect myself, I wear a mask to protect others. I’m triple-vaxxed, regularly testing and being as careful... (continued)"

      "Plus size sewists; welcome to your brand new bible!\n\nHey friends! How are we doing this week? I’m struggling with the change in weather, but the smell of autumn evenings are keeping me above water. That and the cat, but we’ve gone over my crazy cat lady in last week’s blurb. Today, instead, I wanted to talk about a project I modelled for back in April! And so here’s a little first look at the first ever book by the gorgeous and talented Jenny Rushmore. So here’s a look at Ahead of the Curve by Cashmerette!\n\nBefore we get into this; I’m always trying to be as open as possible where my posts come from and things that I may or may not have been given. I was a paid model for Ahead of the Curve, and was given the book in advance because of this. I am not paid to promote this book, and am posting on my own accord because I truly love the book and want everyone to own one! You can always see my disclaimer page for any other information.\n\nAhead of the Curve by Cashmerette\n\nIf you’re a plus size person who sews, you’ve heard of Cashmerette. Chances are, you may even half half a wardrobe of their lovely patterns, because for the longest time it was the only place you could find plus size sewing patterns. I’ve been following the brand for a long time, but hadn’t taken the step to making one of their patterns before. Do I have a reason? Absolutely not; I can still see myself in about 100 versions of the Upton dress!\n\nBut for the uninitiated or the non-sewing people reading... (continued)"

      "Let’s talk about HANDBAGS!\n\nHello friends! How are we doing at the moment? Enjoying the start of Autumn at all? My life is honestly working and kitten rearing and nothing else, so I can’t say I’m doing much at the moment. However, on the subject of work, it’s been a while since I showed off some Vendula products — so why not show you my favourites from the Vendula London AW21 Collection?\n\nBefore we get to the beautiful handbags — I obviously work for Vendula London. It’s in my Disclaimer, even! I actually took these photos in our studio, in front of our little archive wall (gotta brand those photos!) of bags of Vendula past. I don’t think a single one of them is available any more, please don’t message me, haha!\n\nHouse of Jazz Grab Bag\n\nI love a black handbag. I love a black handbag with red accents. A black handbag with red accents AND cats playing instruments? You know I’m down with this 100%. And the really cool thing about the Vendula London AW21 Collection is that the doors you see on the larger bags? They all open!\n\nThis is the Grab Bag style, back with the clasp that makes it super easy to use one-handed; I liked the zipped versions we’ve had for a few seasons, but this is my personal favourite. When I first started working for Vendula, the fact that the Grab Bag handle comes off so you can use the crossbody strap really blew my mind, so it’s always worth mentioning!\n\nAnimal Park Ostrich Tote Bag\n\nLast season we had Animal Park with Flamingoes and...

      "It’s Autumn, baby!\n\nOr as our friends over the pond say, it’s Fall! Fall’s a real cute way of naming Autumn, but you can’t beat the word ‘Autumnal’ right? There’s already been too many mentions of the word autumn in this blurb alone — it’ll lose all meaning by the end of this post. But anyway! Seasons are changing, the weather is about to be depressing for at least six months, and it’s nearly time for All The Holidays! So today I’m going to share a little plus size autumn style wishlist for you all!\n\na // b // c // d // e // f // g // h // i // j // k\n\nPlus Size Autumn Style\n\nAs much as I always end up missing summer around this time, I do love autumn a whole lot. Darker colours are easier to wear (and I do have a penchant for black), and cosy nights and bonfire smells are some of my favourite things in the world. Even forgetting good old Spooky Season, I think everything that autumn has to offer is wonderful.\n\nEven autumn clothing is great — you don’t need to wear your heaviest coats yet, it’s perfect jumper season. My go-to autumnal look is a black turtleneck with a tartan skirt — either mini or midi — paired with some knee-high boots and a beret. Literal perfection in an outfit, as far as I’m concerned! I love blackwatch tartan, so the Banned Sweet Check skirt is a winner; but I do love the classic houndstooth with a twist from Timeless, too.\n\nI’m also slightly obsessed with the dreamy styles of Loud Bodies, like the Komako dress above. Their clothing is... (continued)"

      "Transition seasons suck; and make for the most interesting collections of clothing!\n\nHello friends and welcome back to the blog! I’ve been a bit pro-occupied over the last two weeks, since we welcomed our tiny little black kitten to our home! He came to us last Sunday after being with his rescue aunts for a few weeks. So me and The Fiancé® have spent most of our spare time getting the flat kitten-ready; and then just being obsessed with him. Literally obsessed! Cat-owner friends, do you ever stop being obsessed with your cat? But I digress; this is a fashion blog, is it not? Let’s talk about some late summer plus size Hell Bunny outfits!\n\nThese items were gifted in return for a review and images. Opinions are my own, I’m not paid to say anything in particular. Some links may be affiliate links, it just means I might get a few quid if you buy through my links. You can read more in my disclaimer.\n\nMelonie Jumpsuit\n\nOkay, hear me out here. Yes, it may be a little late for a sleeveless jumpsuit with melons on. BUT, we keep having random hot days that were better than most of the UK’s summer; so I’ll eke out the summer vibes for as long as I possibly can. I am honestly shocked at how this looks on me, honestly. As a person with a big belly, I’ve not worn trousers outside of pyjama bottoms for years now. They aren’t comfortable, they don’t look good. And then there’s this jumpsuit, which has just the right amount of room in the tum and hips to fit my 60″ hips without... (continued)"

      "I’d call this ‘Last of the summer gingham’ but I’ve already named a dress that.\n\nHello friends! How are we all doing? It’s been a few weeks since my last post — well, because honestly I’m having a crisis in whether or not I want to carry on having a traditional blog. Doing the whole blogger/influencer thing in a world where social media is actively working against you sucks. I do enjoy writing and doing little photoshoots for my blog, however, so maybe things aren’t so bad. And today I wanted to show off something I’ve made for once! So here is my plus size Lyra dress from Tilly and the Buttons.\n\nTilly and the Buttons Lyra Dress\n\nWhen the Lyra pattern was released back in April — I was instantly in love. I love a shirtdress, and have done for years. Usually I go for a 50s shirtdress styles with massive ol’ skirts attached, but there was something about the floaty skirt and bishop sleeve that I was nigh-on obsessed with. Of course, since it’s me — I had to make it in a light gingham fabric!\n\nI actually cut out the entirety of this dress back in May. I even filmed the whole of the cutting out for a reel I was planning on doing. And then… it sat there. Until the end of August, when I finally got my arse into gear and sat down and made the whole thing in just over two days.\n\nI’ve never actually made a Tilly and the Buttons pattern before, even though I’ve followed Tilly’s journey since her early blogging days. I’ve always just been outside of their pattern sizing.... (continued)"
