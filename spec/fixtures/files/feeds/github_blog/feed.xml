    <title>GitHub Desktop 1.5 available today</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-14-github-desktop-1-5/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/github-desktop-1-5</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since launching the new GitHub Desktop in 2017, weâ€™ve focused on improving collaboration in the app, laying the foundation how you can work with Desktop today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Earlier this year, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-05-22-github-desktop-1-2/&quot;&gt;launched Desktop 1.2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-07-30-github-desktop-1.3/&quot;&gt;1.3&lt;/a&gt;, providing you with the ability to compare branches and get notified when the default branch has updates to pull into your branch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Last month, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-09-12-github-desktop-1-4/&quot;&gt;released 1.4&lt;/a&gt;, providing information about whether or not youâ€™ll encounter conflicts before merging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, weâ€™re releasing GitHub Desktop 1.5, representing a culmination of the work weâ€™ve been doing this past year. This release completes the merge collaboration cycle by providing a way to initiate a merge in the branch dropdown, guiding you through resolving merge conflicts, and informing you when a merge is complete. It also includes our first step toward improving onboarding onto GitHub Desktop with the option to clone and add new repositories in the repository dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;merge-conflict-resolution&quot;&gt;Merge conflict resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With todayâ€™s GitHub Desktop release, you can merge with confidence knowing that even if conflicts occur, weâ€™ll help you through it so you can keep shipping. Merge conflicts can be intimidating for new developers, especially those working in teams. In our usability tests, the audible â€œNOOOOOâ€ when encountering a conflict became predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our previous release, we reduced some of that anxiety by informing you whether or not you would encounter merge conflicts before merging, but you still needed to actually resolve the conflicts on your own. With more than 10 percent of all merges in the app resulting in merge conflicts, we knew we could do better. And with GitHub Desktop 1.5, youâ€™re no longer on your own. The app will now inform you which files have conflicts, route you to your preferred editor to resolve them, list the conflicts that you still need to address, and show you when everything is resolved and ready to merge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1174461/48432565-95574500-e729-11e8-8f8b-cc73cd9209a3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Merge conflict resolution in action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;listening-to-our-users&quot;&gt;Listening to our users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As weâ€™ve released features related to merging over the past several months, weâ€™ve also had an opportunity to listen to lots of users. We care about your feedback, and this release incorporates several changes based on what weâ€™ve learned from you. With GitHub Desktop 1.5, you can now initiate a merge from the branch dropdown, and youâ€™ll receive feedback in the app to let you know when a merge is completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™ve also seen that the core function of adding a repository to Desktop has been difficult to find and use. We solved this by adding a simple way to create, add, or clone a repository right from the repository dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes are subtle, but together they represent our commitment to listen and learn from people using Desktop every day. We conduct user interviews and usability testing on a regular basisâ€”if youâ€™d like to participate and help make Desktop even more useful, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/VC7HtmuCMDrweKBz1&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;celebrating-our-open-source-contributors&quot;&gt;Celebrating our open source contributors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to call out that this release is the first time weâ€™ve shipped a feature iteration built almost entirely by community contributors outside of GitHub. The improved merge flow was a combined effort from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JQuinnie&quot;&gt;@JQuinnie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bruncun&quot;&gt;@bruncun&lt;/a&gt;, and there were more than 30 merged pull requests from the community since our last release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continue to be blown away by the community that has grown around GitHub Desktop as an open source product. There were more community pull requests merged in September and October than in any previous months, and thereâ€™s no sign of slowing down. Weâ€™re grateful for the communityâ€™s participation in improving GitHub Desktop, and if you feel inspired to build something awesome together, weâ€™d love to see you in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues&quot;&gt;open source repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Happy second birthday to Code.gov</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-09-happy-birthday-codegov/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/happy-birthday-codegov</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41764265/48202193-301ee080-e332-11e8-8067-03f99823d786.png&quot; alt=&quot;Happy birthday, Code.gov!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we celebrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.gov&quot;&gt;Code.gov&lt;/a&gt;â€™s second birthday, it seems like just yesterday Alvand Salehi was &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/u9s_W8lCrDU?t=1943&quot;&gt;introducing Code.gov from the main stage at GitHub Universe&lt;/a&gt;. But now two years and over 5,200 projects later, Code.gov (and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcecode.cio.gov&quot;&gt;Federal Source Code policy&lt;/a&gt; that created it) are starting to hit their stride. I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight some of the exciting government projects currently on GitHub, and dive into the data around how the government community uses GitHub to collaborate.  Like the Code.gov team says, â€œ[we] believe in innovation, and are passionate in making these open source projects all available to you.â€&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;government-and-open-source&quot;&gt;Government and open source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the 4,800 publicly accessible government projects on Code.gov, more than 3,600 (or 75 percent) are hosted on GitHub.com. This makes sense, as the majority of the worldâ€™s open source already on GitHub. However, itâ€™s also a pretty big deal. Government agencies like NASA and the U.S. Army are using GitHub to share their tools and resources with the greater open source community around the world. Take NASAâ€™s 3D Resources project, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested in textures, models, and images from NASA itself? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources&quot;&gt;NASA-3D-Resources&lt;/a&gt; repository has it all, including pictures of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources/blob/master/Images%20and%20Textures/Earth%20-%20Apollo/as10-34-5013.jpg&quot;&gt;earth from the Apollo missions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources/blob/master/3D%20Models/Clementine/clementine_thumb.png&quot;&gt;models of the satellite&lt;/a&gt; used in the Clementine mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You canâ€™t 3D print your own Mars roverâ€”yet. But with contributors like the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, â€œyetâ€ may definitely be the operative word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another exciting government  project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs&quot;&gt;ZFS&lt;/a&gt;, a file system released by the Department of Energy that runs specifically on Linux. This open source project has not only been embraced by other agencies, but has been adopted by private companies as part of their day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable adopters of ZFS on Linux include GE Healthcare Systems, Intel, and Netflix. As for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)â€”the research facility answering to the Department of Energy and those behind this OSSâ€”they continue to utilize ZFS, and continue to develop and improve the platform. LLNL is working closely with Intel to use a variation of ZFS-ZFS+Lustreâ€”to manage the first planned U.S. exascale system, Aurora. Aurora is capable of a billion-billion calculations per second. (Yes, a billion-billion.) Aurora is slated for 2021 at Argonne National Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-government-community-uses-github&quot;&gt;How the government community uses GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from how the government is sharing projects, we also took a look at the numbers to find out how the community is using GitHub to collaborate on these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-more&quot;&gt;And more&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our top 10 findings are just a few examples of how government projects use GitHub. Looking deeper into the data can tell us even more about how they contribute to the entire open source community. With thousands on thousands of commits, many have sparked the attention of both the public and private sector:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the Environmental Protection Agency, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR&quot;&gt;WNTR&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced â€œwinterâ€) is a Python package designed to simulate and analyze resilience of water distribution networks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Department of Transportationâ€™s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode&quot;&gt;ITS ODE&lt;/a&gt; offers real-time data to a network of vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic management centers, providing logistics to subscribing transportation management applications and other similar devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nsacyber/WALKOFF&quot;&gt;Walkoff&lt;/a&gt;, from the National Security Agency, enabling security teams to automate and integrate apps, workflows, and analytics tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what Code.gov is all about. All of the government projects weâ€™ve mentioned in this post are designated as open source. That means that you can access a repo, test, debug, submit pull requests, or download your own copy and adapt it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Code.gov team has shared with us, they believe in innovation and providing everyone the opportunity to perform a civic duty on a digital platform. Theyâ€™re passionate about making these open source government projects available for all. This spirit is embodied in their hashtag, seen often on their Twitter account: #CodeOn. The invitation to reach out to them on Twitter or LinkedIn is always open, and we highly encourage you to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.gov&quot;&gt;Code.gov&lt;/a&gt;? Follow them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/codedotgov&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codedotgov&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. You can also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://government.github.com&quot;&gt;what else GitHub is doing to help governments&lt;/a&gt; across the country and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open source helps people create new and exciting things every dayâ€”including the code we used to collect data for this post. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jbjonesjr/govstats&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thank you for 100 million repositories</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-08-100M-repos/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-08T14:10:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/100M-repos</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29592817/47944318-a81b7f80-dec8-11e8-850b-f646766a568f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thank you for 100M repos&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we reached a major milestone: 100 million repositories now live on GitHub. Powering this number is an incredible community. Together, youâ€™re 31 million developers from nearly every country and territory in the world, collaborating across 1.1 billion contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repositories are where you store code, but they represent much more: ideas, experiments, curiosity, and moments of inspiration. To celebrate, letâ€™s take a look at a few trends and achievements, a core sample of whatâ€™s possible when we work together by the millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-behind-100-million&quot;&gt;Whatâ€™s behind 100 million?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this milestone into perspective, we totaled only about 33,000 repositories in 2008. Today, weâ€™re seeing an average of 1.6 repositories created every second. In fact, nearly one third of all repositories were created in the last year aloneâ€”all thanks to the developers who choose to host, build, and share their work on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, itâ€™s been a pleasure to watch impactful projects build and grow on GitHub. &lt;a href=&quot;https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/4/2/rails-is-moving-from-svn-to-git/&quot;&gt;Rails moved to Git and GitHub&lt;/a&gt; while the platform was still in private beta, and Node.js launched on GitHub in 2009. Since then, weâ€™ve also had the opportunity to host Swift, .NET, and Python. Supported by thousands of contributors, these projects are raising the bar for how developer tools evolve and engage with their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just this year, weâ€™ve seen countless projects take off, started by individuals and larger teams alike. Projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped&quot;&gt;Definitely Typed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/godotengine/godot&quot;&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;, and more climbed our lists of &lt;a href=&quot;https://octoverse.github.com/projects&quot;&gt;top and fastest growing projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Top open source projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects on this yearâ€™s lists have a theme: they make it easier to build software, whether through code editing, automation, containerization, or documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7321362/48171678-d971c200-e2b1-11e8-8ee6-398362951153.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top OS projects in 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fastest-growing-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Fastest growing open source projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year, we saw trends in growth of projects related to machine learning, game development, 3D printing, home automation, data analysis, and full-stack JavaScript development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7321362/48171749-25246b80-e2b2-11e8-92bd-33b2ab694e3e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fastest growing OS projects in 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;popular-repository-topics&quot;&gt;Popular repository topics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the open source repositories youâ€™ve created span thousands of topics, but these are the ones you contributed to the most:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7321362/48171817-66b51680-e2b2-11e8-99f2-3467c803a7b1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top topics tagged in 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics in front and backend JavaScript, machine learning, mobile app development, and containerization represent some of the most powerful trends in open source software in the last 12 months. In 2017, topics like â€œgameâ€, â€œdeep learningâ€, and â€œlibraryâ€ were also trending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-repositories-are-created&quot;&gt;Where repositories are created&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub started with a small group of developers looking to solve a specific problemâ€”now itâ€™s home to a global open source community. And weâ€™re seeing the proportion of open source contributors outside the U.S. grow every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7321362/48171911-b398ed00-e2b2-11e8-8a2a-e2a817e8abc3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Contributors from the US and outside of the US&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a continent, more repositories are coming from Asia than anywhere else in the world. More specifically, repository creation has picked up across Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. While thereâ€™s an increase in repositories from developed countries, weâ€™re seeing the same trend in emerging countries as new tech communities grow and new technologies becoming more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers in Egypt, in particular, created twice as many public and private repositories this year. And in Nigeria, a growing developer community created 1.7x more open source repositories in 2018 than in 2017. To see why we think Nigeria has a tech community to watch, read our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-11-08-regional-spotlight-nigeria/&quot;&gt;latest post on the region&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 10 years and 100 million repositories, weâ€™re only just getting started. Thanks to our users, weâ€™re building something bigger than any single repository or projectâ€”a community thatâ€™s pushing software forward in tangible ways. So thank you for building with us now and in the years to come. We canâ€™t wait to see what you build together in the next 100 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Octoverse regional spotlight on Nigeria</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-08-regional-spotlight-nigeria/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-08T14:05:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/regional-spotlight-nigeria</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7321362/48172801-0b852300-e2b6-11e8-9502-51de78a64ad6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Regional spotlight: Nigeria&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is the first in a series based on The State of Octoverseâ€”trends and insights into GitHub activity, the open source community, and more from the GitHub Data Science Team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-02-21-africa-nigeria-and-their-growing-tech-communities/&quot;&gt;we reflected&lt;/a&gt; on a trip to Nigeria and everything we learned about its growing tech community. Economic changes, expanding educational opportunities, and wider internet access are mobilizing a talented and entrepreneurial community. And together, theyâ€™re pushing software forward in Africaâ€™s largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-growing-developer-community&quot;&gt;A growing developer community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our trip, we saw this changing landscape close up at packed meetups and student groups. In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://octoverse.github.com&quot;&gt;2018 Octoverse Report&lt;/a&gt;, the numbers were clear. Across several measures, the developer community in Nigeria is growing fast. In 2018 alone, weâ€™ve seen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.6x more developers contributing on GitHub.* Nigeria represents the fourth fastest growing developer community on GitHub with 1.6x as many contributors in 2018 than in 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2.1x more organizations. Nigeria is high on our list of fastest growing countries by organizations created with 2.1x more organizations created this year than last year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.8x more repositories and 1.7x more open source repositories. Nigeria also made our list of fastest growing countries by repositories created, nearly doubling the number of projects theyâ€™re collaborating on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about our data and methodologies, check out this yearâ€™s &lt;a href=&quot;https://octoverse.github.com&quot;&gt;State of the Octoverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;We define contributors broadly as any user taking a substantive action on GitHub (pushed code, opened an issue, or merged a pull request, for example) that added new content to the platform in a public or private repository.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;growth-behind-the-numbers&quot;&gt;Growth behind the numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-important-startup-ecosystem&quot;&gt;An important startup ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind our numbers is a young, growing community excited about software development and its potential to address some of the challenges Nigeria faces today. With excitement and opportunity comes an expanding startup ecosystem and the venture capital, accelerators, training programs, and hubs to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigerian startups are growing accordingly across industries. The fintech industry is booming in particular, as a result of a changing financial landscape. According to Stephen Oâ€™Grady, Principal Analyst at Red Monk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2016 and 2017, 42 percent of Nigerians had access to traditional financial services, which has lead to growth in projects that have tried to bring these to the Nigerian population. Without existing infrastructure, they have the opportunity to take the next step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria still relies heavily on cash, but fintech companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://amplifypay.com/&quot;&gt;AmplifyPay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mypaga.com/&quot;&gt;Paga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://paystack.com/&quot;&gt;PayStack&lt;/a&gt; (which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PaystackHQ&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) are streamlining the way people bank and gaining tens of thousands of individual and business users. With millions of dollars raised, these companies underscore an investment trend that has spread across African tech ecosystems, reaching a high of &lt;a href=&quot;http://disrupt-africa.com/funding-report/&quot;&gt;$195 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 alone. These startups have also spurred local developers to build an ecosystem of applications and integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-supportive-student-community&quot;&gt;A supportive student community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through GitHub Education and our global group of Campus Experts, weâ€™ve had the opportunity to support Nigerian students building tech communities that train and mentor new developers within their schools. So far, weâ€™ve watched local Campus Experts create summer coding camps for women, host and speak at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nacoss.org.ng/software-summit-2018&quot;&gt;national software summits&lt;/a&gt; with 1,000+ attendees, organize open source meetups, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://githubcampus.expert/&quot;&gt;Learn more about our Campus Experts program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re excited to see what Nigeriaâ€™s growing developer community builds on GitHub into 2019 and beyond. Want to learn more? GitHub Data Scientist Anna Filippova and Red Monk Principal Analyst Stephen Oâ€™Grady chatted about why Nigeria is trending in a recent GitHub Universe session.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Effective regulation matters&#58; Join us in the GPL Cooperation Commitment</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-07-github-joins-GPL-Cooperation-Commitment/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/github-joins-GPL-Cooperation-Commitment</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, weâ€™re excited to announce that GitHub has joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/gpl-initiative-expands-16-additional-companies-joining-campaign-greater-predictability-open-source-licensing&quot;&gt;40 other software companies&lt;/a&gt; in supporting the GPL Cooperation Commitment. Our hope is that this change will improve fairness and certainty for users of key projects that the developer ecosystem relies on, including Git and the Linux kernel. More broadly, the GPL Cooperation Commitment provides an example of evolving software regulation to better align with social goals, which is urgently needed as developers and policymakers grapple with the opportunities and risks of the software revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-effective-regulation&quot;&gt;What is effective regulation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulations are put in place in order to achieve social goalsâ€”like reducing pollution or protecting consumersâ€”but those goals arenâ€™t automatically achieved. An â€œeffectiveâ€ regulation must direct behavior that will actually further intended goals and not cause &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-03-14-eu-proposal-upload-filters-code/&quot;&gt;too much unintended collateral damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thatâ€™s not all: an effective regulation would also have an enforcement mechanism that encourages compliance rather than creates an opportunity to shake businesses down. Under effective regulation, the most severe penalties for non-compliance, like shutting down a line of business, would be reserved for repeat and intentional violators. Less serious failures to comply, or accidental non-compliance, may only result in warningsâ€”if the violation is promptly corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-the-gpl-as-private-software-regulation&quot;&gt;The current state of the GPL as private software regulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a tool for a &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; regulator (copyright holder) to achieve a social goal: under the license, anyone who receives a covered program has the freedom to run, modify, and share that program. (In contrast, a license like MIT does not regulate what freedoms downstream recipients must be offered. Whether to regulate in this manner or not is &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.guide/legal/#just-give-me-the-tldr-on-what-i-need-to-protect-my-project&quot;&gt;up to the developer&lt;/a&gt; of a program.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the developer does want to regulate, version 2 of the GPL (GPLv2) has one bug from the perspective of an effective regulator: non-compliance results in termination of the license, with no provision for reinstatementâ€”making the license marginally more useful to copyright â€œtrollsâ€ who want to force companies to pay rather than come into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, version 3 of the GPL (GPLv3) fixed this bug by introducing a â€œcure provisionâ€ under which a violator can usually have their license reinstatedâ€”if the violation is promptly corrected. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://choosealicense.com&quot;&gt;choosealicense.com&lt;/a&gt;, we recommend GPLv3 when developers want to use a regulatory license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, GPLv2 has served the Linux kernel, Git, and other developer communities well since 1991, many of which are unlikely to ever switch to GPLv3, as this would require agreement from all copyright holders, and not everyone agrees with all of GPLv3â€™s changes. But GPLv3â€™s cure provision is uncontroversial: could it be backported to GPLv2 licensed projects? In a sense yes, to the extent GPLv2 copyright holders agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-the-gpl-cooperation-commitment-can-help&quot;&gt;How the GPL Cooperation Commitment can help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/&quot;&gt;GPL Cooperation Commitment&lt;/a&gt; is a way for a copyright holder to agree to extend GPLv3â€™s cure provision to all GPLv2 (also LGPLv2 and LGPLv2.1, which have the same bug) licenses offered, giving violators a fair chance to come into compliance and have their licenses reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And importantly, the GPL Cooperation Commitment is an example of making regulation more effective in advancing a social good, like we discussed above. It also incorporates one of  &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html&quot;&gt;several principles&lt;/a&gt; (the others do not relate directly to license terms) for enforcing compliance with the GPL and other copyleft licenses as effective private regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-support-the-gpl-cooperation-commitment&quot;&gt;Why we support the GPL Cooperation Commitment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re happy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/github-gpl-cooperation-commitment/&quot;&gt;agree to the GPL Cooperation Commitment&lt;/a&gt;
because it aligns with GitHubâ€™s core values. Everything we build and support is grounded in empowering the peopleâ€“and the communityâ€“behind the technology. We know GPLv2 will likely remain an important private software regulation for decades to come. Itâ€™s important to ensure that GPLv2 licensees have the ability to fairly correct license violations, and to support effective regulation that improves open source licensing for everyone. We also want to encourage both private and public policymakers to take similar care for effectiveness when considering regulation that will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGZu5MzTtMA&quot;&gt;shape the future of software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-you-can-get-involved&quot;&gt;How you can get involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can join us in making the GPL Cooperation Commitment as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/Company/README-COMPANY.html&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/Individual/README-INDIVIDUAL.html&quot;&gt;individual&lt;/a&gt;. GPLv2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/Project/README-PROJECT.html&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; can add the GPL Cooperation Commitment as an additional permission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five GitHub Field Day organizers share their playbooks for successful events</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-05-five-github-field-day-organizers-share-their-playbooks-for-successful-events/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/five-github-field-day-organizers-share-their-playbooks-for-successful-events</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a student trying to ship code without a community to help you, small setbacks can add up to a massive feeling of frustration, even isolation. Who can you brainstorm with? What about sharing the brilliant solution you devised, 10 pull requests later? As rewarding as contributing to open source can be, itâ€™s also a challenge to go it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://githubfieldday.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Field Day&lt;/a&gt;, a day-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference&quot;&gt;â€œunconferenceâ€&lt;/a&gt;, solves this problem by bringing together students from their local communities to connect and share experiences. This summer marked the first anniversary of GitHub Field Day, which has grown to meet the needs of communities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gathering-to-solve-a-shared-struggle&quot;&gt;Gathering to solve a shared struggle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intern (and now GitHubber) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wilhelmklopp&quot;&gt;Wilhelm Klopp (Wil)&lt;/a&gt; created Field Day to share information across campuses and learn from mistakes, all while making friends. With an unconference, participants in each session can freely engage in discussions, collaborate, take a break, or decide to move to other sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you attend a local Field Day, the structure of the event invites you to participate as little (or as much!) as youâ€™d like. Think of it like a â€œchoose your own adventureâ€ gameâ€”you control your experience, and you can suggest topics for technical discussions and activities that are timely and relevant to you. More importantly, youâ€™ll have fun, feel welcome, and enjoy meeting other student leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDqzC7RvEXE&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47880153-d9c51580-ddf8-11e8-9628-4e69c87d8c20.png&quot; alt=&quot;Field Day HQ&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Student leaders talk about Field Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snapshots-from-field-day-around-the-world&quot;&gt;Snapshots from Field Day around the world&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Field Day is different, and each one has something for us to take away to our local communities. Hereâ€™s a walkthrough to give you a sense of Field Days from each region, along with some helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;field-day-10-at-github-hq&quot;&gt;Field Day 1.0 at GitHub HQ&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47688731-202e3080-dbbd-11e8-8df1-2d05f8e5e3e5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sketchnotes Field Day HQ&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://education.github.com/students/experts&quot;&gt;Campus Expert&lt;/a&gt; Wil noticed a trend that every Expert reported: when a student leader experienced a problem, who did they turn to? There wasnâ€™t an outlet for them in their local communities. This was how the idea for Field Day started, and Wil set out to launch a beta event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47880312-4b04c880-ddf9-11e8-8d2b-d6f53f976e25.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inaugural Field Day&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Inaugural Field Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key skills you learn as a Campus Expert is how to observe the needs of your community. The first Field Day showed that Wil was onto somethingâ€”students want this kind of knowledge base, some form of face-to-face support for their shared struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Field Dayâ€™s project name was â€œUmbrellaâ€â€”an umbrella event for leaders of technical student communities. Ultimately the name evolved, but the project name still hangs on as part of the branding: the purple umbrella â˜”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47880356-696ac400-ddf9-11e8-82a1-e1eb487d2858.png&quot; alt=&quot;First Field Day Schedule&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The first Field Day unconference schedule included a Pizza programming contest, teaching CS to complete beginners, creating the membership identity, inclusivity of international students, and building an API for students at university&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reflect about what worked and didnâ€™t work so you have a roadmap to work from for future events.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take note of trends you see across proposed talksâ€”they might be signs of whatâ€™s missing in your community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;field-day-in-los-angeles-ca&quot;&gt;Field Day in Los Angeles, CA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47863543-e4b68080-ddcd-11e8-968e-7a25ab6936e0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Field Day Los Angeles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Field Day attendees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campus Expert &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubcampus.expert/catherinechung/&quot;&gt;Catherine Chung&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Southern California has a habit of noticing â€œwhatâ€™s missingâ€ in her on-campus community. After joining the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscacm.org/&quot;&gt;ACM chapter&lt;/a&gt;, and creating an all-female hackathon for schools in her region, &lt;a href=&quot;http://athenahacks.com/#about&quot;&gt;AthenaHacks&lt;/a&gt;, she saw how schools in Los Angeles could band together, share resources and distribute the work in ways that would help everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of coming together for mutual benefit, Catherine connected USC with UCLA to house &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubfieldday.com/la2018/&quot;&gt;Field Day Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in a larger venue. Working side-by-side to plan the event, both schools shaped it to serve their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For next time, Catherine plans to seed the event with content that students want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Something that could help add more value to the event is polling the attendees (maybe during the application form) to see what topics or issues theyâ€™d like to talk about, or pairing people up into more relevant groups for lunch. For example, it would have been interesting to pair up the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) student leaders from all the schools in one lunch table so they could talk about collaboration or discuss things theyâ€™re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;takeaways-1&quot;&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help your community grow: 100 percent get connections from other schools to help with planning and outreach!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tinker with the format: The first Field Day in SF was hosted from 8 am to 6:45 pm, which was a little long for college students to commit to during the school semester. Catherine changed LAâ€™s event to be from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feel free to add a little more structure to the event: Catherine was unsure if people would be proactive and suggest discussion topics at the beginning of the event, so she planned a few topics beforehand. This allowed people to create and rehearse presentations prior to the event, which seemed to be pretty helpful for talks like open source and cryptocurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;field-day-in-montreal&quot;&gt;Field Day in Montreal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BbF0K9ID3MO/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47863545-e4b68080-ddcd-11e8-9543-ed54856e464d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Field Day Montreal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 33 attendees, Field Day Montreal (organized by Campus Expert and former Intern &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubcampus.expert/kim-codes/&quot;&gt;kim-codes&lt;/a&gt;) was small enough to focus on one track for the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student leaders opened up about their common problems: recruiting new members, the onboarding process for their organization, keeping in touch with members, and learning how to work as a team. With this agenda in mind, the discussion bloomed to offer solutions (including a poutine day for recruitment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting challenge Field Day Montreal posed was around language: how do you run a conference for student leaders in multiple languages? Perhaps offer slides in English and French, or ask for translation services from student leaders who are multilingual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;takeaways-2&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have trouble recruiting new members: use the schoolâ€™s Association or Club Days. These are great in helping to inform new students about your event. You can also stream sessions with Twitch so that people who are unable to attend can catch up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To train and retain members: try offering small projects/homework, and be clear about membership expectations and requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn how to teach people to work as a team: no one learns or works the same way. Hold a scrum meetings, or change up the executive teams based on particular projects. Donâ€™t forget to plan a team outing with your members to foster team spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Donâ€™t forget to keep in touch: make videos, use Facebook, or even ship a newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;field-day-in-mexico-city&quot;&gt;Field Day in Mexico City&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47863541-e4b68080-ddcd-11e8-9082-82b00bf2f35c.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Field Day Mexico City&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Speakers at Field Day in Mexico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the seven Campus Experts in Mexico, &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubcampus.expert/juanpflores/&quot;&gt;Juan Pablo Flores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubcampus.expert/FernandaOchoa/&quot;&gt;Fernanda Ochoa Ramirez&lt;/a&gt;, organized &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubfieldday.com/mex2018/&quot;&gt;Field Day Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; in February 2018 for both newcomers and seasoned coders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Fernanda, organizing Field Day â€œchanged my lifeâ€â€”she saw ways to improve efficiency, use new communication channels, and bring together 35-50 different communities who previously operated independently. The different clubs shared how to work with universities, sponsors, and the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47863539-e41dea00-ddcd-11e8-9979-c46d7f942678.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Sketchnotes Mexico City&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are currently discussing where to host the next Field Day, and Juan would like to nurture communities outside of Mexico City to grow the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47863537-e41dea00-ddcd-11e8-806c-89efc5db4965.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Collaboration at Mexico City&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;takeaways-3&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share your pain points: With dozens of groups represented, there is a ton of expertise to draw from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify how you can make Field Day a consistent feeling: Juan and other experts are even considering doing a meetup every two to three months to follow up on events people are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look beyond startups and apps: youâ€™re more likely to see problems the community can solve. Juan is looking to diversify their events and bring real problems to solve, such as hackathons on Agrotech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;field-day-in-new-york-city&quot;&gt;Field Day in New York City&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1874003/47873059-99f53280-dde6-11e8-80d7-5ec5ee4d1b44.png&quot; alt=&quot;Field Day NYC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campus Expert &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubcampus.expert/teresawithoutah/&quot;&gt;Teresa Luz Miller&lt;/a&gt; held Field Day NYC at the offices of Major League Hacking (dubbed â€œMLHQâ€) in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NYC Field Day started with a kickoff icebreaker activity called â€œA Cold Wind Blowsâ€, which is a sort of musical chairs game to help people get to know each other. The organizer structured the unconference by asking every attendee to make three post-it notes of what they needed help withâ€”an idea she learned from &lt;a href=&quot;https://maintainerati.org/&quot;&gt;Maintainerati&lt;/a&gt;, the unconference for open source maintainersâ€”and then clustered related ideas together into a schedule. Each small breakout group appointed a facilitator to capture the conversation on the whiteboard, which aided in comprehension and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;takeaways-4&quot;&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the whiteboard: Highlight best concepts while making it bite-sized and aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be flexible with the schedule: The more interactive an event is, the more energy it requires. Like Los Angeles, NYC also ended early because of the (wonderful) intensity of the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;help-for-your-student-community&quot;&gt;Help for your student community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub Field Day has connected students from as far as London and the Midlands in the UK to Mexico City. We would love for you to join us at the next Field Day near you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Git LFS v2.6.0 is now available</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-02-git-lfs-v260/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/git-lfs-v260</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7321362/47939158-8eb40c80-dea3-11e8-9295-2e5b82304bae.png&quot; alt=&quot;Announcing Git LFS 2.6.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-lfs.github.com/&quot;&gt;Git LFS&lt;/a&gt;, the open source Git extension for versioning large files, is now available. Git LFS v2.6.0 comes with a more robust authentication mechanism, new options to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git lfs checkout&lt;/code&gt;, a handful of bug fixes, new platforms, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-lfs.github.com&quot;&gt;Download Git LFS v2.6.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authentication-improvements&quot;&gt;Authentication improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git LFS can make two types of HTTP(s) requests: API requests (which allow the client to retrieve any metadata it might need), and storage requests (which allow the client to upload or download data to external storage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, Git LFS would determine how it should authenticate LFS API requests, then use the same method to authenticate transfer requests. However, API requests and transfer requests generally go to different places and arenâ€™t guaranteed to require the same authentication method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git LFS now treats those requests as requiring different authentication and will determine the correct mode for each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-git-lfs-checkout-options&quot;&gt;New &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git lfs checkout&lt;/code&gt; options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git is designed to handle merge conflicts as best it can without the need for human intervention, but often itâ€™s built-in merge facilities do not resolve conflicts correctly for large files. When thatâ€™s the case, it can be useful to compare the contents of both sides of the conflict by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git lfs checkout&lt;/code&gt; now provides convenient options for doing just that: you can ask it to resolve â€œourâ€ side of a merge, â€œtheirâ€ side, or the merge base. Hereâ€™s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ShellSession&quot;&gt;$ git lfs checkout --ours --to=conflict.psd.ours -- conflict.psd
$ git lfs checkout --theirs --to=conflict.psd.theirs -- conflict.psd
$ git lfs checkout --base --to=conflict.psd.base -- conflict.psd
$ ls -la
-rw-r--r--@  1 user  group   16789 Oct 22 18:59 conflict.psd.base
-rw-r--r--@  1 user  group   19810 Oct 22 18:59 conflict.psd.ours
-rw-r--r--@  1 user  group   18303 Oct 22 18:59 conflict.psd.theirs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, you can open each side of the conflict and resolve the differences however you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-all-of-the-rest&quot;&gt;And all of the rest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youâ€™ll see a handful of other new features and bug fixes in v2.6.0 like new release targets including arm64, enhanced support for more configuration options from Git, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instructions on configuring Git LFS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-git-large-file-storage/&quot;&gt;read the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Suggested changesâ€”what we've learned so far</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-01-suggested-changes-update/"/>
    <updated>2018-11-01T21:34:24+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/suggested-changes-update</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we released suggested changes, a feature that allows you to suggest changes to code in a pull request. Once changes are suggested, the author or assignees can accept (and commit) suggestions with the click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before&quot;&gt;Before&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/602352/47467403-3eaeb900-d7c4-11e8-9c57-b4cca4a26937.png&quot; alt=&quot;A code review comment before suggested changes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after&quot;&gt;After&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/602352/47467407-41a9a980-d7c4-11e8-9374-acb6a7c43b00.png&quot; alt=&quot;A code review comment with a suggested change&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its release, more than 10 percent of all reviewers suggested at least one change, totaling over 100,000 suggestionsâ€”and nearly four percent of all review comments created included a suggestion. Based on these early numbers, we see youâ€™re quick to adopt suggested changes and make them a natural part of your code review workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the number of suggestions created and the feedback we received from over 2,500 people who have used the feature, youâ€™ve helped us understand what we can improve moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the most frequent requests were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to suggest changes to multiple lines at once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to accept multiple changes in a single commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make suggested changes the best feature it can possibly be. Your feedback is valuable and will inform our next steps. Until then, we encourage you to try out suggested changes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.net/r/SuggestedChanges&quot;&gt;tell us what you think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018&quot;&gt;Game Off&lt;/a&gt; is our annual month-long game jam (hackathon for building games). This yearâ€™s theme is &lt;strong&gt;HYBRID&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youâ€™re welcome &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hybrid&quot;&gt;to interpret&lt;/a&gt; the theme however you wish, but if you need some ideas to kickstart your creativity, think about how your game could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=hybrid+animal+object+funny&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS783US783&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtk6mJk6_eAhWmwFQKHdibBdsQ_AUIDigB&amp;amp;biw=1548&amp;amp;bih=894&quot;&gt;imaginary &lt;strong&gt;mashup&lt;/strong&gt; of animals plants, or other objects&lt;/a&gt; with associated strengths and weaknesses. Giraffeopotamuses anyone?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/top10/2158-the-top-10-most-outlandish-hybrid-games-that-really-really&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crossover&lt;/strong&gt; different game genres&lt;/a&gt;, such as a turn-based platformer, real-time roguelike, or tower defense rythm game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine&lt;/strong&gt; multiple visual styles, perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS783US783&amp;amp;biw=1548&amp;amp;bih=894&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=1&amp;amp;ei=jdLYW4D3OsjC0wKK2JGYAg&amp;amp;q=pixel+art+real+world&amp;amp;oq=pixel+art+real+world&amp;amp;gs_l=img.3...2001.4258..4336...0.0..0.289.2368.12j5j3......1....1..gws-wiz-img.......0j0i67j0i10i67j0i30j0i5i30j0i8i30.tOT_gWvaO0Q&quot;&gt;pixel art characters exploring photo-realistic worlds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include a &lt;strong&gt;composition&lt;/strong&gt; of music styles and sound effects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&quot;&gt;bagpipes and breakbeats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix&lt;/strong&gt; genres like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_horror&quot;&gt;Comedy Horror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_West&quot;&gt;Weird West&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be &lt;strong&gt;powered&lt;/strong&gt; by alternative/multiple controls, button mashing meets mousing or mobile device interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-participate&quot;&gt;How to participate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a game based on the theme over the next month. You have from November 1, 13:37 to December 1 13:37 PT.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/join&quot;&gt;Sign up for a free GitHub account&lt;/a&gt; if you donâ€™t already have one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018&quot;&gt;Join the Game Off on itch.io&lt;/a&gt;. If you donâ€™t already have an itch.io account, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/login?intent=jam_submit&amp;amp;return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fitch.io%2Fjam%2Fgame-off-2018&quot;&gt;log in with your GitHub account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/&quot;&gt;Create a new public GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; to store the source code and any assets youâ€™re able to share for your entry. Then push your changes before December 1, 13:37 PT.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit your game through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018&quot;&gt;Game Off page on itch.io&lt;/a&gt; (form viewable once the jam starts and youâ€™ve joined it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participate by yourself or as a team. Multiple submissions are welcome, and of course, the use of open source software is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voting&quot;&gt;Voting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the jam ends, voting will be open to everyone who has submitted a game. Donâ€™t worryâ€”there will be plenty of time to play and vote on the entries. As always, weâ€™ll highlight some of our favorites on the GitHub Blog, and the world will get to enjoy (and maybe even contribute to or learn from) your creations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The GitHub Community Forum is turning one</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-31-community-forum-turns-1/"/>
    <updated>2018-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/community-forum-turns-1</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18125109/47372439-62340f80-d6af-11e8-9519-82e63f4b17e8.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub Community Forum turns 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are celebrating the first anniversary of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.community/&quot;&gt;GitHub Community Forum&lt;/a&gt;. One year ago today, we began with just three discussion boards, a single &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Original-Series/ct-p/GitHubOriginalSeries&quot;&gt;GitHub Original Series article&lt;/a&gt;, and a burning desire to provide a new space for connecting, collaborating, and learning. Though our discussion boards and articles have evolved, weâ€™re just as excited to bring you even  more valuable content over the next year as we were when we initially started the Community Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-reflection-on-the-first-year-of-the-github-community-forum&quot;&gt;A reflection on the first year of the GitHub Community Forum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since October 31, 2017, there have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;625,000 unique visitors to github.community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;18,000 registered people on the GitHub Community Forum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visitors from over 100 countries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5,500 conversations (and growing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;40 GitHub Original Series articles published&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 185 challenge badges earned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re working hard to make the Community Forum even better. Over the next year, we will be adding new features and experiences. Here are a few new and exciting improvements you can look forward to in 2019â€¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new look for our homepage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More GitHub Original Series articles with new and interesting topics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More challenges and contests, with chances to earn badges and swag&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New ways to earn rewards and become more involved in the Community Forum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And so much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to thank you  for your contributions, and hope you continue to share with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;become-a-part-of-the-community&quot;&gt;Become a part of the community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you havenâ€™t joined the GitHub Community Forum, itâ€™s never too late! Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.community/&quot;&gt;Community Forum&lt;/a&gt; and log in with your github.com account to start sharing your experiences with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Atom understands your code better than ever before</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-31-atoms-new-parsing-system/"/>
    <updated>2018-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/atoms-new-parsing-system</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/46065834-2429f580-c1ae-11e8-9a89-1a55f9baddb3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tree sitter has landed in Atom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text editors like Atom have many features that make code easier to read and writeâ€”&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting&quot;&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_folding&quot;&gt;code folding&lt;/a&gt; are two of the most important examples. For decades, all major text editors have implemented these kinds of features based on a very crude understanding of code, obtained by searching for simple, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression&quot;&gt;regular expression&lt;/a&gt; patterns. This approach has severely limited how helpful text editors can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At GitHub, we want to explore new ways of making programming intuitive and delightful, so weâ€™ve developed a parsing system called &lt;a href=&quot;http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/&quot;&gt;Tree-sitter&lt;/a&gt; that will serve as a new foundation for code analysis in Atom. Tree-sitter makes it possible for Atom to parse your code while you typeâ€”maintaining a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree&quot;&gt;syntax tree&lt;/a&gt; at all times that precisely describes the structure of your code. Weâ€™ve enabled the new system by default in Atom, bringing a number of improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crisp-syntax-highlighting&quot;&gt;Crisp syntax highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atomâ€™s syntax highlighting is now based on the syntax trees provided by Tree-sitter. This lets us use color to outline your codeâ€™s structure more clearly than before. Notice the consistency with which &lt;span style=&quot;color: #e45649;&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #4078f2;&quot;&gt;functions&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #a626a4;&quot;&gt;keywords&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0184bc;&quot;&gt;types&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #383a42;&quot;&gt;variables&lt;/span&gt; are highlighted across a variety of languages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/326587/47454076-15ba0400-d783-11e8-95e0-b08c3689f26d.gif&quot; alt=&quot;This animated GIF shows a snippet of C code rendered in Atom. It then switches to show an equivalent snippet of code written in several different languages: C++, Go, Rust, and TypeScript.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reliable-code-folding&quot;&gt;Reliable code folding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most text editors, code folding is based on indentation: lines with greater indentation are considered to be nested more deeply than lines with less indentation. But this doesnâ€™t always match the structure of our code and can make code folding useless in some files. With Tree-sitter, Atom folds code based on its syntax, which allows folding to work as expected, even for code like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/326587/47458789-4ef87100-d78f-11e8-8541-661a529cd574.gif&quot; alt=&quot;This animated GIF shows a snippet of Ruby code, containing a heredoc with unindented text. Code folding is used to first collapse the block containing the heredoc, then collapse the method containing that block, and then collapse the class containing that method.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;syntax-aware-selection&quot;&gt;Syntax-aware selection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atom also uses syntax trees as the basis for two new editing commands: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Select Larger Syntax Node&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Select Smaller Syntax Node&lt;/code&gt;, bound to &lt;kbd&gt;Alt+Up&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;Alt+Down&lt;/kbd&gt;. These commands can make many editing tasks more efficient and fun, especially when used in combination with multiple cursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/326587/47385613-623c0b80-d6bf-11e8-8fd3-3d044229cc98.gif&quot; alt=&quot;This animated GIF shows a snippet of JavaScript code in Atom. First, nothing is selected. Then, larger and larger constructs in the code are selected.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speed&quot;&gt;Speed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parsing an entire source file can be time-consuming. This is why most IDEs wait to parse your code until you stop typing for a moment, and there is often a delay before syntax highlighting updates. We want to avoid these delays, so we designed Tree-sitter to parse your code incrementally: it keeps the syntax tree up to date as you edit your code without ever having to re-parse the entire file from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/326587/47468808-58470500-d7b2-11e8-9a39-d8ed7e4bc341.gif&quot; alt=&quot;tree-editing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;language-support&quot;&gt;Language support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, we use Tree-sitter to parse 11 languages: Bash, C, C++, ERB, EJS, Go, HTML, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and TypeScript. And weâ€™ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/18257&quot;&gt;added Rust support&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/beta&quot;&gt;our Beta channel&lt;/a&gt;. If youâ€™d like to help us bring the power of Tree-sitter to more languages, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/&quot;&gt;Tree-sitter documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-grammar/&quot;&gt;grammar page&lt;/a&gt; of the Atom Flight Manual.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>October 21 post-incident analysis</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-30-oct21-post-incident-analysis/"/>
    <updated>2018-10-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/oct21-post-incident-analysis</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, GitHub experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-10-21-october21-incident-report/&quot;&gt;an incident&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in degraded service for 24 hours and 11 minutes. While portions of our platform were not affected by this incident, multiple internal systems were affected which resulted in our displaying of information that was out of date and inconsistent. Ultimately, no user data was lost; however manual reconciliation for a few seconds of database writes is still in progress. For the majority of the incident, GitHub was also unable to serve webhook events or build and publish GitHub Pages sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us at GitHub would like to sincerely apologize for the impact this caused to each and every one of you. Weâ€™re aware of the trust you place in GitHub and take pride in building resilient systems that enable our platform to remain highly available. With this incident, we failed you, and we are deeply sorry. While we cannot undo the problems that were created by GitHubâ€™s platform being unusable for an extended period of time, we can explain the events that led to this incident, the lessons weâ€™ve learned, and the steps weâ€™re taking as a company to better ensure this doesnâ€™t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of user-facing GitHub services are run within our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubengineering.com/evolution-of-our-data-centers/&quot;&gt;data center facilities&lt;/a&gt;. The data center topology is designed to provide a robust and expandable edge network that operates in front of several regional data centers that power our compute and storage workloads. Despite the layers of redundancy built into the physical and logical components in this design, it is still possible that sites will be unable to communicate with each other for some amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 22:52 UTC on October 21, routine maintenance work to replace failing 100G optical equipment resulted in the loss of connectivity between our US East Coast network hub and our primary US East Coast data center. Connectivity between these locations was restored in 43 seconds, but this brief outage triggered a chain of events that led to 24 hours and 11 minutes of service degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/network-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;A high-level depiction of GitHub's network architecture, including two physical datacenters, 3 POPS, and cloud capacity in multiple regions connected via peering.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, weâ€™ve discussed how we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubengineering.com/orchestrator-github&quot;&gt;MySQL to store GitHub metadata&lt;/a&gt; as well as our approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubengineering.com/mysql-high-availability-at-github&quot;&gt;MySQL High Availability&lt;/a&gt;. GitHub operates multiple MySQL clusters varying in size from hundreds of gigabytes to nearly five terabytes, each with up to dozens of read replicas per cluster to store non-Git metadata, so our applications can provide pull requests and issues, manage authentication, coordinate background processing, and serve additional functionality beyond raw Git object storage. Different data across different parts of the application is stored on various clusters through functional sharding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve performance at scale, our applications will direct writes to the relevant primary for each cluster, but delegate read requests to a subset of replica servers in the vast majority of cases. We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/orchestrator&quot;&gt;Orchestrator&lt;/a&gt; to manage our MySQL cluster topologies and handle automated failover. Orchestrator considers a number of variables during this process and is built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://raft.github.io/&quot;&gt;Raft&lt;/a&gt; for consensus. Itâ€™s possible for Orchestrator to implement topologies that applications are unable to support, therefore care must be taken to align Orchestratorâ€™s configuration with application-level expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/normal-topology.png&quot; alt=&quot;In the normal topology, all apps perform reads locally with low latency.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;incident-timeline&quot;&gt;Incident timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2252-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 22:52 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the network partition described above, Orchestrator, which had been active in our primary data center, began a process of leadership deselection, according to Raft consensus. The US West Coast data center and US East Coast public cloud Orchestrator nodes were able to establish a quorum and start failing over clusters to direct writes to the US West Coast data center. Orchestrator proceeded to organize the US West Coast database cluster topologies. When connectivity was restored, our application tier immediately began directing write traffic to the new primaries in the West Coast site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database servers in the US East Coast data center contained a brief period of writes that had not been replicated to the US West Coast facility. Because the database clusters in both data centers now contained writes that were not present in the other data center, we were unable to fail the primary back over to the US East Coast data center safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2254-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 22:54 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our internal monitoring systems began generating alerts indicating that our systems were experiencing numerous faults. At this time there were several engineers responding and working to triage the incoming notifications. By 23:02 UTC, engineers in our first responder team had determined that topologies for numerous database clusters were in an unexpected state. Querying the Orchestrator API displayed a database replication topology that only included servers from our US West Coast data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2307-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 23:07 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point the responding team decided to manually lock our internal deployment tooling to prevent any additional changes from being introduced. At 23:09 UTC, the responding team placed the site into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054147648930897920&quot;&gt;yellow status&lt;/a&gt;. This action automatically escalated the situation into an active incident and sent an alert to the incident coordinator. At 23:11 UTC the incident coordinator joined and two minutes later made the decision change to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054148705450946560&quot;&gt;status red&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2313-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 23:13 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was understood at this time that the problem affected multiple database clusters. Additional engineers from GitHubâ€™s database engineering team were paged. They began investigating the current state in order to determine what actions needed to be taken to manually configure a US East Coast database as the primary for each cluster and rebuild the replication topology. This effort was challenging because by this point the West Coast database cluster had ingested writes from our application tier for nearly 40 minutes. Additionally, there were the several seconds of writes that existed in the East Coast cluster that had not been replicated to the West Coast and prevented replication of new writes back to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guarding the confidentiality and integrity of user data is GitHubâ€™s highest priority. In an effort to preserve this data, we decided that the 30+ minutes of data written to the US West Coast data center prevented us from considering options other than failing-forward in order to keep user data safe. However, applications running in the East Coast that depend on writing information to a West Coast MySQL cluster are currently unable to cope with the additional latency introduced by a cross-country round trip for the majority of their database calls. This decision would result in our service being unusable for many users. We believe that the extended degradation of service was worth ensuring the consistency of our usersâ€™ data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/invalid-topology.png&quot; alt=&quot;In the invalid topology, replication from US West to US East is broken and apps are unable to read from current replicas as they depend on low latency to maintain transaction performance.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2319-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 23:19 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear through querying the state of the database clusters that we needed to stop running jobs that write metadata about things like pushes. We made an explicit choice to partially degrade site usability by pausing webhook delivery and GitHub Pages builds instead of jeopardizing data we had already received from users. In other words, our strategy was to prioritize data integrity over site usability and time to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0005-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 00:05 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineers involved in the incident response team began developing a plan to resolve data inconsistencies and implement our failover procedures for MySQL. Our plan was to restore from backups, synchronize the replicas in both sites, fall back to a stable serving topology, and then resume processing queued jobs. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054161818652946433&quot;&gt;updated our status&lt;/a&gt; to inform users that we were going to be executing a controlled failover of an internal data storage system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/recovery-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overview of recovery plan was to fail forward, synchronize, fall back, then churn through backlogs before returning to green.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While MySQL data backups occur every four hours and are retained for many years, the backups are stored remotely in a public cloud blob storage service. The time required to restore multiple terabytes of backup data caused the process to take hours. A significant portion of the time was consumed transferring the data from the remote backup service. The process to decompress, checksum, prepare, and load large backup files onto newly provisioned MySQL servers took the majority of time. This procedure is tested daily at minimum, so the recovery time frame was well understood, however until this incident we have never needed to fully rebuild an entire cluster from backup and had instead been able to rely on other strategies such as delayed replicas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0041-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 00:41 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A backup process for all affected MySQL clusters had been initiated by this time and engineers were monitoring progress. Concurrently, multiple teams of engineers were investigating ways to speed up the transfer and recovery time without further degrading site usability or risking data corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0651-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 06:51 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several clusters had completed restoration from backups in our US East Coast data center and begun replicating new data from the West Coast. This resulted in slow site load times for pages that had to execute a write operation over a cross-country link, but pages reading from those database clusters would return up-to-date results if the read request landed on the newly restored replica. Other larger database clusters were still restoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our teams had identified ways to restore directly from the West Coast to overcome throughput restrictions caused by downloading from off-site storage and were increasingly confident that restoration was imminent, and the time left to establishing a healthy replication topology was dependent on how long it would take replication to catch up. This estimate was linearly interpolated from the replication telemetry we had available and the status page was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054264047250608130&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; to set an expectation of two hours as our estimated time of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0746-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 07:46 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-10-21-october21-incident-report&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; to provide more context. We use GitHub Pages internally and all builds had been paused several hours earlier, so publishing this took additional effort. We apologize for the delay. We intended to send this communication out much sooner and will be ensuring we can publish updates in the future under these constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1112-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 11:12 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All database primaries established in US East Coast again. This resulted in the site becoming far more responsive as writes were now directed to a database server that was co-located in the same physical data center as our application tier. While this improved performance substantially, there were still dozens of database read replicas that were multiple hours delayed behind the primary. These delayed replicas resulted in users seeing inconsistent data as they interacted with our services. We spread the read load across a large pool of read replicas and each request to our services had a good chance of hitting a read replica that was multiple hours delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the time required for replication to catch up had adhered to a power decay function instead of a linear trajectory. Due to increased write load on our database clusters as users woke up and began their workday in Europe and the US, the recovery process took longer than originally estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1315-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 13:15 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, we were approaching peak traffic load on GitHub.com. A discussion was had by the incident response team on how to proceed. It was clear that replication delays were increasing instead of decreasing towards a consistent state. Weâ€™d begun provisioning additional MySQL read replicas in the US East Coast public cloud earlier in the incident. Once these became available it became easier to spread read request volume across more servers. Reducing the utilization in aggregate across the read replicas allowed replication to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1624-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 16:24 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the replicas were in sync, we conducted a failover to the original topology, addressing the immediate latency/availability concerns. As part of a conscious decision to prioritize data integrity over a shorter incident window, we kept the service &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054408042836606977&quot;&gt;status red&lt;/a&gt; while we began processing the backlog of data we had accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1645-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 16:45 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this phase of the recovery, we had to balance the increased load represented by the backlog, potentially overloading our ecosystem partners with notifications, and getting our services back to 100% as quickly as possible. There were over five million hook events and 80 thousand Pages builds queued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we re-enabled processing of this data, we processed ~200,000 webhook payloads that had outlived an internal TTL and were dropped. Upon discovering this, we paused that processing and pushed a change to increase that TTL for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid further eroding the reliability of our status updates, we remained in degraded status until we had completed processing the entire backlog of data and ensured that our services had clearly settled back into normal performance levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-2303-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 23:03 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All pending webhooks and Pages builds had been processed and the integrity and proper operation of all systems had been confirmed. The site status was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054508689560870912&quot;&gt;updated to green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving-data-inconsistencies&quot;&gt;Resolving data inconsistencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our recovery, we captured the MySQL binary logs containing the writes we took in our primary site that were not replicated to our West Coast site from each affected cluster. The total number of writes that were not replicated to the West Coast was relatively small. For example, one of our busiest clusters had 954 writes in the affected window. We are currently performing an analysis on these logs and determining which writes can be automatically reconciled and which will require outreach to users. We have multiple teams engaged in this effort, and our analysis has already determined a category of writes that have since been repeated by the user and successfully persisted. As stated in this analysis, our primary goal is preserving the integrity and accuracy of the data you store on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our desire to communicate meaningful information to you during the incident, we made several public estimates on time to repair based on the rate of processing of the backlog of data. In retrospect, our estimates did not factor in all variables. We are sorry for the confusion this caused and will strive to provide more accurate information in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-initiatives&quot;&gt;Technical initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of technical initiatives that have been identified during this analysis. As we continue to work through an extensive post-incident analysis process internally, we expect to identify even more work that needs to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adjust the configuration of Orchestrator to prevent the promotion of database primaries across regional boundaries. Orchestratorâ€™s actions behaved as configured, despite our application tier being unable to support this topology change. Leader-election within a region is generally safe, but the sudden introduction of cross-country latency was a major contributing factor during this incident. This was emergent behavior of the system given that we hadnâ€™t previously seen an internal network partition of this magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have accelerated our migration to a new status reporting mechanism that will provide a richer forum for us to talk about active incidents in crisper and clearer language. While many portions of GitHub were available throughout the incident, we were only able to set our status to green, yellow, and red. We recognize that this doesnâ€™t give you an accurate picture of what is working and what is not, and in the future will be displaying the different components of the platform so you know the status of each service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the weeks prior to this incident, we had started a company-wide engineering initiative to support serving GitHub traffic from multiple data centers in an active/active/active design. This project has the goal of supporting N+1 redundancy at the facility level. The goal of that work is to tolerate the full failure of a single data center failure without user impact. This is a major effort and will take some time, but we believe that multiple well-connected sites in a geography provides a good set of trade-offs. This incident has added urgency to the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will take a more proactive stance in testing our assumptions. GitHub is a fast growing company and has built up its fair share of complexity over the last decade. As we continue to grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to capture and transfer the historical context of trade-offs and decisions made to newer generations of Hubbers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizational-initiatives&quot;&gt;Organizational initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident has led to a shift in our mindset around site reliability. We have learned that tighter operational controls or improved response times are insufficient safeguards for site reliability within a system of services as complicated as ours. To bolster those efforts, we will also begin a systemic practice of validating failure scenarios before they have a chance to affect you. This work will involve future investment in fault injection and chaos engineering tooling at GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know how much you rely on GitHub for your projects and businesses to succeed. No one is more passionate about the availability of our services and the correctness of your data. We will continue to analyze this event for opportunities to serve you better and earn the trust you place in us.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pull request successfully merged. Starting build...</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/"/>
    <updated>2018-10-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/github-and-microsoft</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/40890924-4bad5ce0-6732-11e8-9648-192aa71f0830.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub and Microsoft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m thrilled to share that the Microsoft acquisition of GitHub is complete. ðŸŽ‰ Monday is my first day as CEO. Millions of people rely on GitHub every day, and I am honored by the opportunity to lead this company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we announced the acquisition in June, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://natfriedman.github.io/hello/&quot;&gt;shared two principles&lt;/a&gt; for GitHub that are worth repeating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub will operate independently as a community, platform, and business.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that GitHub will retain its developer-first values, distinctive spirit, and open extensibility. We will always support developers in their choice of any language, license, tool, platform, or cloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub will retain its product philosophy.&lt;/strong&gt; We love GitHub because of the deep care and thoughtfulness that goes into every facet of the developerâ€™s experience. I understand and respect this, and know that we will continue to build tasteful, snappy, polished tools that developers love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my job is to make GitHub better for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve spent the past few months meeting with hundreds of developers as I prepared for this role, from maintainers to startups to large businesses. The passion for GitHub is amazingâ€”both in the areas where we excel and in the areas where you want us to do more. Iâ€™ve learned a lot from these conversations, and listening to our customers will be a core part of how GitHub operates as a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three objectives will be top of mind for us as we build the future of GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring GitHub is the best place to run productive communities and teams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making GitHub accessible to more developers around the world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reliability, security, and performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start by focusing on the daily experience of using GitHub and will double down on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-08-28-announcing-paper-cuts/&quot;&gt;paper cuts project&lt;/a&gt;. We will improve core scenarios like search, notifications, issues/projects, and our mobile experience. And of course we are excited to make GitHub Actions broadly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe in the power of communitiesâ€”that we can all achieve more when we collaborate with others. As the worldâ€™s largest developer community, GitHub brings together over 31 million developers to create, collaborate, share, and build on each otherâ€™s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our vision is to serve every developer on the planet, by being the best place to build software. This is a dream opportunity for all of us at GitHub, and we couldnâ€™t be more excited to roll up our sleeves and start this next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub is FedRAMP Authorized</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-24-github-is-fedramp-authorized/"/>
    <updated>2018-10-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/github-is-fedramp-authorized</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world use GitHub to build software, shape policy, and share information with constituents. To better support the missions of our government community, we participated in the US governmentâ€™s recent efforts to streamline the security review and authorization for certain software toolsâ€”and today weâ€™re pleased to share that GitHub Business Cloud is authorized via the FedRAMP Tailored baseline of security controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exciting milestone means government users can continue to use GitHub with the confidence that our platform meets the low impact software-as-a-service (SaaS) baseline of
 security standards set by our US federal government partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://government.github.com/&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-fedramp&quot;&gt;What is FedRAMP?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US General Services Administrationâ€™s (GSA) Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) standardizes security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud products and services by federal agencies. Instead of agencies individually authorizing cloud service offerings, FedRAMP offers a single authorization process, speeding up the governmentâ€™s adoption of cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FedRAMP applies to a wide range of government technology services. The team at GSA recognized an opportunity to fine-tune FedRAMP specifically for software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers, allowing GitHub to provide feedback as they created the new FedRAMP Tailored framework. Weâ€™ve completed the assessment phase and Business Cloud has secured the FedRAMP Tailored Authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;privacy-and-security-enhancements-for-the-github-community&quot;&gt;Privacy and security enhancements for the GitHub community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2009, The New York Senate was the first government organization to post code to GitHub. In 2013 the GSA made their initial commitâ€”and today GitHub has thousands of active government users. Agencies use GitHub to develop software, collaborate with the public on open source, publish data sets, solicit input on policies, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tailored framework lowers the barrier to entry for cloud software providers interested in securing FedRAMP Authorization. Itâ€™s our hope that the new framework controls helps SaaS providers more efficiently meet government security standards and makes it easier for federal, state, and local government agencies to use the development tools they need to do their best work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GitHubâ€™s FedRAMP Authorized service, agencies can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Securely collaborate in the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foster innovation and continuously test new ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modernize the way you build software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not restricted to government agenciesâ€”and everyone in the GitHub community can benefit from these security and privacy enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU copyright updateâ€”GitHub goes to Brussels</title>
    <link href="https://blog.github.com/2018-10-23-github-goes-to-brussels/"/>
    <updated>2018-10-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/github-goes-to-brussels</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-09-17-whats-next-for-the-EU-copyright-proposal/&quot;&gt;our work on EU copyright reform&lt;/a&gt;, last week GitHub visited Brussels to host an event for developers and policymakers about open source and copyright. During our trip, we also met with EU policymakers who are negotiating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Copyright-Directive_4-column-document_ARTICLES-v2-23102018.pdf&quot;&gt;final details&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eua/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0593&quot;&gt;EU Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;. Read on for a full event recap and to get the latest on where things stand for open source in the current negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;highlighting-open-source-in-the-copyright-debate&quot;&gt;Highlighting open source in the copyright debate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since GitHubâ€™s first trip to Brussels in February, weâ€™ve worked alongside other companies, organizations, and developers in the open source software community to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-03-14-eu-proposal-upload-filters-code/&quot;&gt;raise awareness&lt;/a&gt; about the EU Copyright Directive. While we recognize that current copyright laws are outdated in many respects and need modernization, we are concerned that some aspects of the EUâ€™s proposed copyright reform package would inadvertently affect software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of our ongoing efforts to mobilize developers and educate policymakers about this, GitHub hosted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-source-software-and-copyright-from-industry-40-to-smes-tickets-51031323061#&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; last Tuesday in Brussels with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openforumeurope.org/&quot;&gt;OpenForum Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;. We invited EU developers, policymakers, researchers and more to join us for Open Source and Copyright: from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0&quot;&gt;Industry 4.0&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes&quot;&gt;SMEs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenForum Europeâ€™s Astor Nummelin Carlberg welcomed the crowd, and then James Lovegrove from Red Hat moderated a round of lightning talks on different topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy&lt;/strong&gt;: For GitHub, I shared how developers have been especially effective in getting policymakers to respond to problems with the  copyright proposal and asked them to continue reaching out to policymakers about a technical fix to protect open source.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers&lt;/strong&gt;: Speaking from a developerâ€™s perspective, Evis Barbullushi (Red Hat) explained why open source is so fundamental to software and critical to the EU, using examples of what open source powers every day, as well as underscoring the world-class and commercially mainstream nature of open source.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMEs&lt;/strong&gt;: Sebastiano Toffaletti (European Digital SME Alliance) described concerns about the copyright proposal from the perspective of SMEs, including how efforts to regulate large platforms can end up harming SMEs even if theyâ€™re not the target.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research, academia&lt;/strong&gt;: Roberto Di Cosmo (Software Heritage) wrapped up the talks by noting that he â€œshould not be here,â€ because in a world in which software was better understood and valued, policymakers would never introduce a proposal that inadvertently puts software at great risk, and motivated developers to fix this underlying problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41764265/47319304-4c293f00-d61c-11e8-91e8-bdacce0e4d57.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub's Abby Vollmer discusses open source and copyright in Brussels&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;GitHubâ€™s Abby Vollmer shares what developers can do to help with the EU copyright negotiations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the formal discussion, we finished out the evening with drinks and great conversations  among developers, policy wonks, reporters, researchers, and policymakers alike. A big thank you to everyone who came out for the event and participated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;status-of-open-source-in-the-negotiations&quot;&gt;Status of open source in the negotiations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our work isnâ€™t over yet. In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-09-17-whats-next-for-the-EU-copyright-proposal/&quot;&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt;, we explained that the EU Council, Parliament, and Commission were ready to begin final-stage negotiations of the copyright proposal. Theyâ€™ll resume negotiations this Thursday. Of the parts most relevant to developers, negotiators from those three institutions are now working on exceptions to copyright for text and data mining (Article 3), among other â€œtechnicalâ€ elements of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 13 (which would likely drive many platforms to use upload filters on user-generated content) is expected to be a thornier discussion, so negotiators are trying to get the technical elements resolved first. And since Article 2 defines which services are in the scope of Article 13, Articles 2 and 13 will be discussed together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means itâ€™s not too late to contact these policymakers with your thoughts on what outcomes are best for software development. Hereâ€™s our take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;article-2-related-to-article-13&quot;&gt;Article 2 (related to Article 13)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr = Council, adopt the Parliamentâ€™s language in Article 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Article 2 is important because it determines which services need to comply with Article 13. As an overall note, the language Article 2 uses to define what those services are could use some clarity, especially around what words like â€œorganises,â€ â€œoptimises,â€ and â€œpromotesâ€ mean. However, there are a few outstanding issues with the definition that are more directly relevant for software development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Councilâ€™s attempt to exclude open source software development platforms from the definition is currently ineffective because it would only apply to non-for-profit platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Parliamentâ€™s version of the definition would exclude all â€œopen source software developing platforms.â€ To more effectively protect software development, Member States in the Council just need to make this technical fix: â€œ~not-for-profit~ open source software developing platforms.â€&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe weâ€™ve made some headway in our meetings last week in Brussels by describing how many software development platforms run as a business, but do not profit from content posted under an open source license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distinction isnâ€™t intuitive, and developers can help educate policymakers about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How you collaboratively build software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why itâ€™s useful to be able to use software thatâ€™s licensed as open source&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That developers who license their code under an open source license understand they arenâ€™t going to earn money from licensing fees or royalties on that code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whether a platform is a non-for-profit isnâ€™t the same as whether a platform is monetizing or otherwise profiting from publicly posted code under an open source license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;article-3&quot;&gt;Article 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr = Adopt Article 3a as a mandatory exception.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On Article 3, including a broader exception for text and data mining that extends beyond only research organizations for scientific, non-profit purposes will be crucial for EU developers. However, thatâ€™s currently proposed as an optional exception (Article 3a). So why should the exception be mandatory, not just optional?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EU developers will need the protection of a broader, mandatory exception to keep up with countries like the U.S. that donâ€™t require the kinds of licenses proposed in the EU Copyright Directive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A mandatory exception also makes more sense in the spirit of harmonizing standards across the EU and creating a predictable legal environment for developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-you-can-help&quot;&gt;How you can help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/whoiswho/public/index.cfm?fuseaction=idea.hierarchy&amp;amp;nodeID=6623&quot;&gt;your Council members&lt;/a&gt; to explain that limiting the software exclusion to only non-for-profits in Article 2 would fail to protect open source software in Europe. On Article 3, tell them why a broad, mandatory exception for text and data mining will help EU developers and businesses stay competitive. Make it clear how important this exception will beâ€”especially where artificial intelligence and machine learning are at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers, letâ€™s help policymakers get these parts of the proposal right.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2018-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.github.com/october21-incident-report</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At 10:52 pm Sunday UTC, multiple services on GitHub.com were affected by a network partition and subsequent database failure resulting in inconsistent information being presented on our website. Out of an abundance of caution we have taken steps to ensure the integrity of your data, including pausing webhook events and other internal processing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware of how important our services are to your development workflows and are actively working to establish an estimated timeframe for full recovery. We will share this information with you as soon as it is available. During this time, information displayed on GitHub.com is likely to appear out of date; however no data was lost. Once service is fully restored, everything should appear as expected. Further, this incident only impacted website metadata stored in our MySQL databases, such as issues and pull requests. Git repository data remains unaffected and has been available throughout the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue to provide updates and an estimated time to resolution via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.github.com&quot;&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11401067/45983587-ff008000-c011-11e8-8014-45557464b6f3.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub Universe, October 16-17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at GitHub Universe, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/actions/&quot;&gt;announced GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;, a new way to automate and customize your workflows. Configuring the apps and services that make up your development cycle takes significant time and effort. GitHub Actions applies open source principles to workflow automation, weaving together the tools you use from idea to production into one complete workflow. You can also create, share, and discover any actions your projects require, just as you would create, share, and discover code on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/actions/&quot;&gt;Learn more about actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we prepared for Universe, we shared GitHub Actions with a group of customers, integrators, and open source maintainers to see what they could do. In just a few short weeks, talented teams and individuals alike have created hundreds of GitHub Actions. During todayâ€™s Universe keynote, we heard directly from developers, and weâ€™re excited to share their work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flic-all-your-tools-at-the-press-of-a-button&quot;&gt;Flic: All your tools at the press of a button&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/295657348?color=ffffff&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œWe built Flic to let people enjoy the services they love in the simplest way possible: at the push of a button. GitHub is loved and used by millions of developers. Weâ€™re delighted to partner up with them, and let their community find their own creative ways to simplify their daily life with the endless possibilities of Flic.â€&lt;/em&gt; - Elin HÃ¤rÃ©n, Flic CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flic opens up endless opportunities to get creative and simplify your daily life by controlling devices, apps, and services with the press of a button. Combined with GitHub Actions, Flic becomes a powerful (and fun) tool to customize and automate your workflow beyond command lines and keyboards. Use Flic to trigger specific actions or tasks within a GitHub repositoryâ€”and turn your development workflow tactile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pulumi-a-flexible-automated-solution-for-continuous-deployment&quot;&gt;Pulumi: A flexible, automated solution for continuous deployment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/295662003?color=ffffff&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œThe combination of GitHub Actions and Pulumi gives teams an easy, automated solution for the deployment of cloud applications and infrastructure to any cloud, purely using code and Git.â€&lt;/em&gt; - Joe Duffy, Pulumi Co-founder and CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulumiâ€™s open source SDK allows developers to write cloud applications and infrastructure in their programming language of choice. Combined with GitHub Actions, Pulumi offers total insight into deployment status and a flexible, automated solution for continuous deployment to any cloudâ€”AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, or even on-premisesâ€”straight from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With actions and Pulumi, teams can edit application or infrastructure-related files to trigger deployments, either by committing changes or merging pull requestsâ€”no manual steps or Bash scripting required. From here, you can preview, diff, and record deployments. And with Pulumiâ€™s GitHub App, you can propose, approve, and promote code from staging to production using pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pulumi.com/github&quot;&gt;pulumi.com/github&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;netlify-next-level-integration-and-powerful-new-features&quot;&gt;Netlify: Next-level integration and powerful new features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/295659187?color=ffffff&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œMany of Netlifyâ€™s customers deploy sites and apps directly to our global Application Delivery Network from their GitHub repositories. The new functionality in GitHub Actions allows us to take that workflow to the next level, with much tighter integrations and more powerful features.â€&lt;/em&gt; - Mathias Biilmann, Netlify CEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify allows you to build, deploy, and manage web projects. They provide a workflow that combines global deployment, continuous integration, and automatic HTTPS. Using GitHub Actions, Netlify provides tighter integration and more powerful features. If you have a monorepo with multiple sites, you can now use actions to trigger the deploy of only the sites that have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hashicorp-terraform-simplified-pull-request-review-with-github-actions&quot;&gt;HashiCorp Terraform: Simplified pull request review with GitHub Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/295659330?color=ffffff&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œGitHub Actions made iterating on Terraform code in a pull request flow simple. It checked some really common mistakes, and it showed us the plan that would have happened. This makes collaborating with teammates on infrastructure changes intuitive and seamless.â€&lt;/em&gt; - Mitchell Hashimoto, HashiCorp Founder and CTO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HashiCorp Terraform is an open source tool that enables developer to create, change, and improve infrastructure. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared among team members and treated as code: edited, reviewed, and versioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terraform uses GitHub Actions to automate checking for errors in your Terraform configuration, adding the Terraform plan to the pull request itself, and simplifying pull request review with Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jessie-frazelle-developer-advocate-simple-automated-open-source-workflows&quot;&gt;Jessie Frazelle, Developer Advocate: Simple, automated open source workflows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/295657577?color=ffffff&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œThis was faster than everything else I was doing, because Iâ€™m no longer running so many bots or sending to as many different services.â€&lt;/em&gt; - Jessie Frazelle, Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft Azure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie Frazelle is a developer advocate at Microsoft Azure and former maintainer of Docker. She has also contributed to Runc, Golang, Kubernetes, and the Linux kernel, to name some of her other work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before GitHub Actions, her open source workflow was complicated: tools pieced together and integrated with excessive orchestration. In order to work with all of the containers she needed, Jessie had to use an automation server to coordinate her release process. With GitHub Actions, Jessie was able to simplify and automate the entire development workflow right within GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chewycom-a-repeatable-and-error-free-compliance-workflow&quot;&gt;Chewy.com: A repeatable and error-free compliance workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/295656803?color=ffffff&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œAt Chewy, we use GitHub Business Cloud. We get all the benefits of GitHub.com, plus Enterprise integrations like SSOâ€”and we donâ€™t have to maintain the infrastructure ourselves. When we tried GitHub Actions, they just worked. Theyâ€™re simple to create, set up, and configure. They have a low barrier to entry, and theyâ€™re built into GitHub. We were able to get up and running in less than a week.â€&lt;/em&gt; - Peter Buckley, Manager of Software Automation at Chewy.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chewy.com is an online retailer of pet food and other pet-related products, owned by PetSmart. Peter Buckley, Manager of Software Automation at Chewy.com, used GitHub Actions to create a repeatable compliance workflow that keeps pull requests and commits in the correct format. The workflow reduces the number of errors in data formatting and catches issues before they become problems. In fact, Chewy no longer needs to attempt to host bots themselves and can rely on GitHub processing the actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launchdarkly-automated-feature-management-with-a-focus-on-product-not-processing&quot;&gt;LaunchDarkly: Automated feature management with a focus on product, not processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/295658294?color=ffffff&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€œAs we built this integration we realized that GitHub Actions are incredibly flexible. But they can be made even more flexible by using feature flags within workflows. Here, weâ€™ve made an action that checks a feature flag every time we do a commit.â€&lt;/em&gt; - Edith Harbaugh, LaunchDarkly CEO and Co-founder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaunchDarkly is a feature flag management platform used to eliminate risk when deploying changes to production. Development teams use feature flags as a best practice to separate code deployments from feature releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using GitHub Actions, LaunchDarkly automated adding pull request reviewers to the corresponding feature flags to allow them to test out new features automatically. When the feature flag is removed, a separate action finds all of the feature flag locations and notifies LaunchDarkly, simplifying its removal. With GitHub Actions, LaunchDarkly can focus on their core product and off-load some processing to GitHubâ€”all to the benefit of their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://launchdarkly.com/blog/github-actions-controlled-with-launchdarkly&quot;&gt;launchdarkly.com&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
