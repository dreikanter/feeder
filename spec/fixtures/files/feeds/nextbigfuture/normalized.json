      "NASA’s InSight Mars lander has successfully landed on Mars. InSight’s two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. It is on the Mars’ equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia. InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight’s instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight’s 5.9-foot-long\n\nThe post Mars Insight Lander Will Drill Into Mars and Test for Marsquakes appeared first on NextBigFuture.com."

      "A WeChat public account of an official Chinese media said there is a new aircraft carrier that has been built on the berth. This is being interpreted as official confirmation that China is building a third aircraft carrier. China’s third aircraft carrier will have nearly double the displacement of the Liaoning aircraft carrier. The third carrier may reach 80,000 tons and should have electromagnetic catapult launching of jets. This would be far closer to the 100,000 to 107,000 tons of the US Gerald Ford super-carrier and Nimitz carrier. An 80,000-ton aircraft carrier would be larger than the 72,000 ton Queen\n\nThe post China’s Making Bigger Third Aircraft Carrier appeared first on NextBigFuture.com."
