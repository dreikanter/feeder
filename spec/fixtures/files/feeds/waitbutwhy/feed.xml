        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey readers! Quick note before we jump in:</p>
<p>This is a post about something I’ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are—which is weird because I’m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it’s super clear he has very little idea what he’s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.</p>
<p>This post isn’t me giving you career advice really—it’s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You’re not a pro at this, but you’re certainly more qualified to figure out what’s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren’t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren’t sure you&#8217;re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity.</p>
<p>Finally, it feels very good to put this post up. It’s been way, way too long. The last year has been pretty frustrating for me and anyone who likes Wait But Why—a lot of build-up of ideas with none of the satisfying release of those ideas on the blog (most of my last year has been spent working on another, way longer post). I’m hoping this WBW Dark Ages era is nearing its end, because I miss hanging out here. Thanks, as always, to the small group of ridiculously generous, ridiculously patient patrons who have stuck with us through such a slow period.</p>

<h5><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Your Life Path So Far</strong></span></h5>
<p>For most of us, childhood is kind of like a river, and we’re kind of like tadpoles.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/river-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6780" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/river-2.png" alt="" width="761" height="425" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/river-2.png 1357w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/river-2-300x168.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/river-2-768x429.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/river-2-600x335.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></a></p>
<p>We didn’t choose the river. We just woke up out of nowhere and found ourselves on some path set for us by our parents, by society, and by circumstances. We’re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be. Our job isn’t to think about our path—it’s to succeed on the path we’ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for us.</p>
<p>For many of us—and I suspect for a large portion of Wait But Why readers—our childhood river then feeds into a pond, called college.<a href="#footnote-1-6721" id="note-1-6721" rel="footnote">1</a> We may have some say in which particular pond we landed in, but in the end, most college ponds aren’t really that different from one another.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1.png"><img class="wp-image-6781 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1.png" alt="" width="673" height="488" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1.png 1518w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1-300x217.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1-768x557.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1-600x435.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></a></p>
<p>In the pond, we have a bit more breathing room and some leeway to branch out into more specific interests. We start to ponder, looking out at the pond&#8217;s shores—out there where the real world starts and where we&#8217;ll be spending the rest of our lives. This usually brings some mixed feelings.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Looking-at-shore-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6743" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Looking-at-shore-2.png" alt="" width="627" height="456" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Looking-at-shore-2.png 1100w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Looking-at-shore-2-300x218.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Looking-at-shore-2-768x559.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Looking-at-shore-2-600x436.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></a></p>
<p>And then, 22 years after waking up in a rushing river, we’re kicked out of the pond and told by the world to go make something of our lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6732" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="427" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-1.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-1-281x300.jpg 281w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-1-768x819.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-1-563x600.jpg 563w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>There are a few problems here. One is that at that moment, you’re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6733" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="427" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-281x300.jpg 281w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-768x819.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-563x600.jpg 563w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>But before you can even address your general uselessness, there&#8217;s an even bigger issue—your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path—except you. And you&#8217;ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you&#8217;ve only been in charge of the micro decisions—&#8221;How do I succeed at my job as a student?&#8221;—and now you&#8217;re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; and &#8220;What are the important things in life?&#8221; and &#8220;What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?&#8221; When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we&#8217;ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.</p>
<p>Then time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life’s story.</p>
<p>At the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life’s path in its entirety, from an aerial view.</p>
<p>When scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren&#8217;t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don&#8217;t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn&#8217;t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.</p>
<p>So this is a post about path-making. Let’s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we’re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>The Cook and the Chef—Revisited</strong></span></p>
<p>In the past, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’ve written about</a> the critical distinction between “reasoning from first principles” and “reasoning by analogy”—or what I called being a “chef” vs. being a “cook.” Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I’ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life.</p>
<p>The idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist. You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good. By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning—reasoning by analogy—happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there—kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.</p>
<p>A pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity.</p>
<p>Being a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy—which makes sense, because you’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you’re trying to invent it for the first time. Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error. Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce. Right now, I’m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I’m trying to conform. Throughout my life, I’ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I’ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense—because clothes aren’t important to me, and they’re not how I choose to express my individuality. So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.<a href="#footnote-2-6721" id="note-2-6721" rel="footnote">2</a>
<p>But then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important—like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities.</p>
<p>Career-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let’s spell out the obvious reasons why:</p>
<p><strong>Time. </strong>For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours. At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you’ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you’re left with 250,000 “meaningful adult hours.”<a href="#footnote-3-6721" id="note-3-6721" rel="footnote">3</a> So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time—not something to be a cook about.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6735" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png" alt="" width="600" height="713" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png 900w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-253x300.png 253w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-768x912.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-505x600.png 505w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Quality of Life. </strong>Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you’re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.</p>
<p><strong>Impact. </strong>On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own. We can’t test this, but I’m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future—but the <em>kind</em> of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.</p>
<p><strong>Identity. </strong>In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to <em>be</em> when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we <em>are. </em>We don’t say, “I practice law”—we say, “I am a lawyer.” This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person’s career quadruples as the person’s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.</p>
<p>So yeah—your career path isn’t like my shitty sweatshirt. It’s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in “Definitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it” territory.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Your Career Map</strong></span></p>
<p>Which brings us to you. I don’t know exactly what your deal is. But there’s a good chance you’re somewhere in one of the blue regions—</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Life-path.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6736" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Life-path.png" alt="" width="750" height="293" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Life-path.png 1064w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Life-path-300x117.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Life-path-768x300.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Life-path-600x235.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>—which means your career path is a work in progress.<a href="#footnote-4-6721" id="note-4-6721" rel="footnote">4</a>
<p>Whether you’re yet to start your career or well into it, somewhere in the back of your mind (or maybe in the very front of it) is a “Career Plans” map.</p>
<p>We can group map holders into three broad categories—each of which is well-represented in the river, in the pond, standing on the shore, and at every stage of adult life.</p>
<p>One group of people will look at the map and see a big, stressful question mark.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6737" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map1.png" alt="" width="349" height="350" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map1.png 488w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map1-150x150.png 150w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map1-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></a></p>
<p>These are people who feel indecisive about their career path. They’ve been told to follow their passion, but they don’t feel especially passionate about anything. They’ve been told to let their strengths guide them, but they’re not sure what they’re best at. They may have felt they had answers in the past, but they’ve changed and they’re no longer sure who they are or where they’re going.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Other people will see a nice clear arrow representing a direction they feel confident is right—but find their legs walking in a different direction. They’re living with one of the most common sources of human misery, a career path they know in their heart is wrong.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6738" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map2.png" alt="" width="242" height="350" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map2.png 322w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map2-207x300.png 207w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /></a></p>
<p>The lucky ones feel they know where they want to go and believe they’re marching in that direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6739" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map3.png" alt="" width="305" height="350" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map3.png 275w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map3-261x300.png 261w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></a></p>
<p>But even these people should pause and ask themselves, “Who actually drew this arrow? Was it really me?” The answer can get confusing.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure all of these people would benefit from a moment of career path reflection.</p>
<div class="wbwAside">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>Extremely fair question. One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, “Am I qualified to write about this?” Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic:</p>
<p>1) I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path.</p>
<p>2) My path has taken a lot of turns—from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy.</p>
<p>3) After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That’s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong.</p>
<p>4) On top of having my own story to look at, I’ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I’ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal.</p>
<p>5) Finally, this isn’t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful—there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I’m not one of them. It’s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve taken a fresh look at your Career Plans map, along with whatever arrow may or may not be on it, put it down and out of sight. We’ll come back to it at the end of the post. It’s time now for a deep dive—let’s think about this from scratch. From first principles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cook-chef post</a>, I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices. At its core is a simple Venn diagram.</p>
<p>The first part of the diagram is the Want Box, which contains all the careers you find desirable.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6740" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box.png" alt="" width="300" height="318" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box.png 1544w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box-283x300.png 283w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box-768x813.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box-567x600.png 567w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The second part of the diagram is the Reality Box. The Reality Box is for the set of all careers that are realistic to potentially achieve—based on a comparison, in each case, between your level of potential in an area and the general difficulty of achieving success in that area.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6741" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box.png" alt="" width="375" height="304" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box.png 1970w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box-300x244.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box-768x623.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box-600x487.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a></p>
<p>The overlapping area contains your optimal career path choices—the set of arrows you should consider drawing on your Career Map. We can call it the Option Pool.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6742" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn.png" alt="" width="450" height="287" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn.png 1586w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-300x191.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-768x490.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-600x383.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>This is straightforward enough. But actually filling in these boxes accurately is way harder than it looks. For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down. Let’s start with the Want Box.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>Deep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Box</strong></span></p>
<p>The hard thing about the Want Box is that you want a bunch of different things—or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants—and fears—its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it’ll specifically mean going directly <em>against</em> others. The Want Box is a game of compromise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>The Yearning Octopus</strong></span></p>
<p>To do a proper Want Box audit, you need to think about what you yearn for in a career and then unpack the shit out of it. Luckily, we have someone here who can help us. The Yearning Octopus.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6744" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="514" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1.png 1400w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1-300x257.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1-768x658.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1-600x514.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>We each have our own personal Yearning Octopus<a href="#footnote-5-6721" id="note-5-6721" rel="footnote">5</a> in our heads. The particulars of each person’s Yearning Octopus will vary, but people also aren’t all that different from each other, and I bet many of us feel very similar yearnings and fears (especially given that I find that Wait But Why readers tend to have a lot in common).</p>
<p>The first thing to think about is that there are totally distinct yearning <em>worlds</em>—each living on one tentacle. These tentacles often do not get along with each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2a.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6745" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2a.png" alt="" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2a.png 1400w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2a-300x180.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2a-768x461.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2a-600x360.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2B.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6820" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2B.png" alt="" width="682" height="482" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2B.png 1377w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2B-300x212.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2B-768x543.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2B-600x424.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>It gets worse. Each tentacle is made up of a bunch of different individual yearnings and their accompanying fears—and <em>these </em>often massively conflict with each other too.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-3-segmented-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6856" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-3-segmented-1.png" alt="" width="670" height="574" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-3-segmented-1.png 1400w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-3-segmented-1-300x257.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-3-segmented-1-768x658.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-3-segmented-1-600x514.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each tentacle to see what’s going on.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/personal-tentacle.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6748" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/personal-tentacle.png" alt="" width="500" height="494" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/personal-tentacle.png 1214w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/personal-tentacle-300x297.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/personal-tentacle-768x759.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/personal-tentacle-600x593.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The Personal Yearnings tentacle is probably the hardest one to generalize here—it’s pretty particular to each of us. It’s a reflection of our specific personality and our values, and it bears the burden of probably the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment. It’s also in the shit dealing with not only our current selves, but a bunch of our past selves too. The dreams of 7-year-old you and the idealized identity of 12-year-old you and the secret hopes of 17-year-old you and the evolving passions of your current self are all somewhere on the personal tentacle, each throwing their own little fit about getting what they want, and each fully ready to make you feel horrible about yourself with their disappointment and disgust if you fail them. On top of that, your fear of death sometimes emerges on the personal tentacle, all needy about you leaving your mark and achieving greatness and all that. The personal tentacle is why you don’t find very many billionaires content to spend the rest of their life sipping cocktails on the beach—it’s a highly needy tentacle.</p>
<p>And yet, the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected. Because in many cases, it’s the ickiest set of yearnings to really <em>go</em> for; because the fears of this tentacle aren’t scary in an immediate way—they creep in out of the background over time; and because the personal tentacle is always at risk of getting bowled over early in your career by the powerful animal emotions of the other tentacles. This neglect can leave a person with major regrets later on once the dust settles. An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person—who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6749" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png" alt="" width="500" height="459" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png 1218w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-300x275.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-768x704.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-600x550.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The Social Yearnings tentacle is probably our most primitive, animal side, with its core drive stemming back to our tribal evolutionary past. On the tentacle are a number of odd creatures.</p>
<p>As we’ve discussed <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">before</a> on this blog, we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who’s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us. This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval. He really really really wants to be in the in-group and he really really really doesn’t want to be in the outgroup. He’s <a href="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mammoth1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite cute</a> though.</p>
<p>Then there’s your ego, who’s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn’t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon—ideally, on a mass scale. More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.</p>
<p>There are other characters milling about as well. Somewhere else on the social tentacle is a little judge with a little gavel who gets very butthurt if it thinks people aren’t judging you fairly—if you’re not appropriately appreciated. It’s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are. The judge is also big on holding grudges—which is the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to <em>show</em> that person or those people who never believed in them.</p>
<p>Finally, some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner, and who just cannot bear the thought of disappointing them. The one problem with this adorable creature is that its owner isn’t you. It’s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you’re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It’s probably a parent.)</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6750" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png" alt="" width="500" height="522" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png 1079w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-287x300.png 287w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-768x802.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-574x600.png 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day. But like, a really pleasant, enjoyable day—with plenty of free time and self-care and relaxation and luxuries.</p>
<p>It’s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible—as far as your lifestyle tentacle is concerned, you should be able to do what you want to do in life, when and how you want to do it, with the people you like most. Life should be full of fun times and rich experiences, but it should also roll by smoothly, without too much hard work and as few bumps in the road as possible.</p>
<p>The issue is, even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it’s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time. The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn’t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6846" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png" alt="" width="847" height="726" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png 1400w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-300x257.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-768x658.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-600x514.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></p>
<p>The Moral Yearnings tentacle thinks the rest of the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus are a real pack of dicks—each one more self-involved and self-indulgent than the next. The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing; they see billions of people no less worthy than you of a good life who just happened to be born into inferior circumstances; they see an uncertain future ahead that hangs in the balance between utopia and dystopia for life on Earth—a future we can actually push in the right direction if we could only get our other tentacles out of our way. While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to <em>deploy</em>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the other tentacles of your Yearning Octopus find the moral tentacle to be insufferable. They also can’t begin to understand philanthropy for philanthropy’s sake—they think, “Other people aren’t me, so why would I spend my time and energy working to help them?”—but they <em>can </em>understand philanthropy for their own motive&#8217;s sake. While the moral and lifestyle tentacles tend to be in direct conflict, others may sometimes find common ground—the social tentacle can get very into philanthropy if it’ll happen to win you respect and admiration from a highly regarded social group, and some people’s personal tentacle may find the meaning or self-worth it so craves in a philanthropic endeavor.</p>
<p>That’s why, when you do something philanthropic—or anything altruistic, really—there are a few separate things going on in your head. The part of you <em>determined </em>to get proper public credit for the deed lives on your social tentacle; the part of you that thinks “God I’m a good person” lives on your personal tentacle; and the part of you that really loves seeing the person or group you helped be better off lives on your moral tentacle. Likewise, <em>not </em>doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles—the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem.</p>

<p>Your Practical Yearnings tentacle thinks all of this is fine and great—but it would also like to point out that it’s March 31st and your rent is due tomorrow, and the funny thing about that is that it logged into your bank account and saw that the number of dollars in it is actually less than the number of dollars that your landlord will need from you sometime in the next 34 hours. And yeah it knows that you deposited that check on Thursday and that it’s supposed to clear tomorrow morning, but your practical tentacle also could have sworn that just last month, all the tentacles promised that they’d make some sacrifices in order to build up at least a little bank account cushion so that simply paying the rent wouldn’t have to be really fucking stressful every month. Your practical tentacle also can’t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person, and that your lifestyle tentacle chose to rent what sure seems like a pretty nice-ass apartment for someone now living check to check, and that the updates have gotten real quiet from your friend about that bagel delivery service he started six months ago that your moral tentacle happily invested $2,500 in to help it get off the ground, and oh also that meanwhile your personal tentacle has everyone sweating their dick off working at two comedy-writing internships simultaneously that somehow manage to bring in less money combined than you made dressing up as an Egyptian enchantress to wait tables at Jekyll &amp; Hyde sophomore year of college.</p>
<p>At its basic level, your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn’t really care how these things happen—it just wants them to happen. But then everyone else on the octopus makes your practical tentacle’s life super hard by being fucky about things. Every time your income goes up, your lifestyle tentacle decides to raise the bar on what it wants and expects, leaving your practical tentacle continually in the shit trying to cover it all so you don’t have to run up your credit card debt. Your personal tentacle has all of these weird needs that take up a lot of time and more often than not aren’t exactly big money-makers. And while your practical tentacle would be totally down to just ask your rich uncle for money to help out, your social tentacle outlawed asking others for money because “it’s not a good look,” with your personal tentacle chiming in that “yeah, we’re better than that.”</p>
<p>So that’s the situation. You’ve got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren’t enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a <em>single</em> yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can’t figure out what it’s most passionate about.</p>

<p>Or when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still.</p>
<p>Or when you decide to satisfy your urge to help others, before realizing that the part of you that wants to dedicate your life to helping to mitigate humanity’s greatest existential risks has palpable disdain for the part of you that would rather make a tangible positive impact on your local community—while the part of you that can’t stand the thought of the millions of today’s humans without access to clean water finds both of those other yearnings to be pretty cold and heartless.</p>
<p>So yeah, your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus—that’s why you’ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Dissecting the Octopus</strong></span></p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s return to your Want Box. When we think about our career goals and fears and hopes and dreams, our consciousness is just accessing the net output of the Yearning Octopus—which is usually made up of its loudest voices. Only by digging into our mind’s subconscious can we see what’s really going on.<a href="#footnote-6-6721" id="note-6-6721" rel="footnote">6</a>
<p>The cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house. It’s not off-limits to us—it’s just in the basement. We can go look at it anytime—we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement, and B) actually spend the time and energy to go down there, even though going down there might suck.</p>
<p>So let’s head to the basement of your mind to look for the octopus. Unless you’re one of those people who’s really practiced at analyzing your subconscious, it might be dark in the basement, making it hard to see your octopus. The way to start turning the lights on is by identifying what your conscious mind currently knows about your yearnings and fears, and then unpacking it.</p>
<p>Like if there’s a certain career path that sounds fantastic to you, unpack that. Which tentacles in particular are yearning for that career—and which specific parts of those tentacles?</p>
<p>If you’re not currently working towards that career you supposedly yearn for, try to figure out why not. If you think it’s because you’re afraid of failing, unpack <em>that</em>. Fear of failure can emerge from any of the tentacles, so that’s not a specific enough analysis. You want to find the specific source of the fear. Is it a social tentacle fear of embarrassment, or of being judged by others as not that smart, or of appearing to be not that successful to your romantic interests? Is it a personal tentacle fear of damaging your own self-image—of confirming a suspicion about yourself that haunts you? Is it a lifestyle tentacle fear of having to downgrade your living situation, or of bringing stress and instability into a currently predictable life? Or maybe that fear of a living situation downgrade isn’t actually emerging from your lifestyle tentacle, but more so from your social tentacle—in other words, is it possible you&#8217;re indifferent about the apartment change itself but super concerned about the <em>message</em> a lifestyle downgrade sends to your friends and family? Or are there financial commitments you simply cannot back out of at the moment, and your practical tentacle is in a genuine panic about how you’ll make ends meet should this career switch take longer than expected to work out, or not work out at all? Or are a few of these combining together to generate your fear of making the leap?</p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t really think it’s fear of failure that’s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it’s a dread of the change in identity—both internally and externally—that inevitably accompanies a career move like this. Maybe it’s the heavy weight of inertia—an intense resistance to change—that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings. In either case, you’d want to unpack the feeling and ask yourself exactly which tentacles are so opposed to an identity shift, or so driven by inertia.</p>
<p>Maybe you pine to be rich. You fantasize about a life where you make $1.2 million a year, and you feel a tremendous drive to make it happen. All five tentacles can feel a desire for wealth under certain circumstances, each for their own reasons. Unpack it.</p>
<p>As you unpack an inner drive to make money, maybe you discover that at its core, the drive is more for a sense of security than for vast wealth. That can be unpacked too. A yearning for security at its simplest is just your practical tentacle doing what your practical tentacle does. But maybe it’s not actually basic security you want as much as a guarantee of a certain level of fanciness demanded by your lifestyle or social tentacle. Or perhaps what you really want is a level of security so over-the-top secure it can no longer be called a security yearning—instead, it may be an impulse by the emotional well-being section of your lifestyle tentacle to alleviate a compulsive financial stress you were raised to forever feel, almost regardless of your actual financial situation.</p>
<p>The answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity.</p>
<p>You’ll also come to understand which of your inner yearnings seem to speak the loudest in your mind and carry the most pull in your decision-making processes. Pretty quickly, a yearning hierarchy will begin to reveal itself. You’ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Searching for Imposters</strong></span></p>
<p>We’re making good progress—but we’re just getting started. Once you have a reasonably clear picture of your Yearning Octopus, you can start doing the real work—work that takes place another level down in your subconscious, in the basement of the basement. Here, you can set up a little interrogation room and one by one, bring each yearning down into it for a cross-examination.</p>
<p>You’ll start by asking each yearning: how did you end up here, and why are you the way you are? Desires, beliefs, values, and fears don’t materialize out of nowhere. They’re either developed over time by our internal consciousness as observations and life experience pour in, or they’re implanted in us from the outside, by someone else. In other words, they’re the product of either you the chef or you the cook.</p>
<p>So the goal here in your creepy interrogation room is to tug on the faces of each of your yearnings to find out if it’s authentically you, or if it’s someone else <em>disguised </em>as you.</p>
<p>You can pull on a yearning’s face by playing the Why Game. You’ll ask your initial Why—<em>Why is this something I want?—</em>and get to some kind of Because. Then you’ll keep going. Why did that particular Because lead you to want what you now want? And when did that particular Because gain so much gravity with you? You’ll get to a deeper Because behind the Because. And if you continue with this, you’ll usually discover one of three things:</p>
<p>1) You’ll trace the Why back to its origin and reveal a long chain of authentic evolution that developed through deep independent thought. You’ll pull on their face and confirm that the skin is real.</p>
<p>2) You’ll trace the Why back to an original Because that someone else installed in you—<em>I guess the only reason I actually have this value is because my mom kind of forced it on me—</em>and you realize that you never really thought to consider whether you actually independently agree with it. You never stopped to ask yourself whether your own accumulated wisdom actually justifies the level of conviction you feel about that core belief. In a case like this, the yearning is revealed to be an imposter pretending to be an authentic yearning of yours. You pull on its face and it’s a mask that comes off, exposing the yearning’s original installer underneath.</p>
<p>3) You’ll trace the Why back and back and get kind of lost in a haze of “I guess I just know this because it’s true!” This could be an authentic you thing, or just another version of #2, in an instance where you can’t recall the moment this feeling was installed in you. Somewhere deep in you, you’ll have a hunch about which it is.</p>
<p>In a #1 scenario, you can be proud that you developed that part of you like a chef. It’s an authentic and hard-earned feeling or value.</p>
<p>In a #2 or maybe #3 scenario, you’ve discovered that you’ve been duped. You’ve let someone else sneak onto your Yearning Octopus while you weren’t looking. When it comes to that particular belief of yours, you’re a cook following someone else’s recipe—an obedient robot reciting desires and fears out of someone else’s brain.</p>
<p>There’s a chance you’re an unusually wise person whose examination reveals an octopus developed mostly by you and kept readily up to date. More likely, you’re like me and most of my friends—your interrogation room reveals some definite imposters, or at least a lot of ambiguity. Like, underneath one mask, you’ll find your mom.</p>

<p>You’ll pull off others to reveal the values and judgments of broader conventional wisdom, or the viewpoints of your more immediate community, or what’s considered cool by the dominant culture of your generation or the immediate culture within your closest group of friends.</p>

<p>Sometimes you’ll get to the end of a Why-Because pathway only to find the philosophy in a famous novel, or something a celebrity hero of yours once said in an interview, or a strong opinion one of your professors always repeated.</p>
<p>You might even find that some of your yearnings and fears were written by you…when you were seven years old. Like a childhood dream that was etched into the back of your consciousness as the thing you believe you <em>really </em>want, when you’re being <em>truly</em> honest.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6760" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-7.png" alt="" width="316" height="450" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-7.png 409w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-7-211x300.png 211w" sizes="(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px" /></a></p>

<p>The interrogation room probably won’t be that fun a time. But it’s time well spent—because you’re not your 7-year-old self, just like you’re not your parents or your friends or your generation or your society or your heroes or your past decisions or your recent circumstances. You’re Current-Age You—the only person, and the only version of yourself, who is actually qualified to want and not want the things you want and don’t want.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn’t to say that it’s wrong to live by the words of a wise parent or a famous philosopher or friends you respect or the convictions of a younger you. Humble people are by <em>definition </em>influence-able—influences are an important and inevitable part of who each of us is. The key distinction is this:</p>
<p>Do you treat the words of your external influences as information, held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you’ve carefully decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in your brain, <em>masquerading as </em>inner you?</p>
<p>Do you want the same thing someone else you know wants because you heard them talk about it, you thought about it alongside your own life experience, and you eventually decided that, for now, you agree? Or because you heard someone talk about what they want or fear, and you thought, “I don’t know shit and that person does, so if they say X is true, I’m sure they’re right”—and then you etched those ideas into your mind, never again feeling the need to question them?</p>
<p>The former is what chefs do. The latter is what you do when you’re being an obedient robot. And a robot is what you become when at some point you get the idea in your head that someone else is more qualified to be you than you are.</p>
<p>The good news is that all humans make this mistake—and you can fix it. Just like your subconscious is right there for viewing if you want to view it—it’s also there for changing and updating and rewriting. It’s your head—you’re allowed to do with it what you want.</p>
<p>So it’s time for some evictions. Masked imposters have to go. Even mom and dad.</p>
<p>At the end of this, your octopus may look a little barren, leaving you feeling a little like you don’t know who you even are anymore. We usually think of this as a bad feeling, or even an existential crisis, but it actually means you’re doing better than most people.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6802" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="775" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2.png 1135w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2-300x291.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2-768x744.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2-600x581.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>The drop from naive over-confidence to wise, realistic humility never feels good, but pausing the roller coaster while it’s still on that first cliff and avoiding the pain—which turns out to be a lot of people’s move—isn’t a great strategy. Wisdom isn’t correlated with knowledge, it’s correlated with being in touch with reality—it’s not how far to the right you are on the graph, it’s how close you are to the orange line. Wisdom hurts at first, but it’s the only place where actual growth happens. The irony is that the cliff-pausers of the world like to make the wiser, braver valley-dwellers or continual-climbers feel bad about themselves—because they fundamentally don’t get how knowing yourself works. They haven’t reached that stage yet.</p>
<p>Getting to know your real self is super hard and never complete. But if you’ve tumbled off the cliff, you’ve gone through a key rite of passage and progress is now possible. As you climb up the orange line, you’ll slowly but surely begin to repopulate your Yearning Octopus with your real self.</p>
<p>At the moment, it probably won’t be obvious what those missing yearnings of yours are exactly—because they’re on an even deeper floor of your subconscious. They’re in the basement of the basement of the basement—in a place called Denial Prison.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Denial Prison</strong></span></p>
<p>Our brain’s Denial Prison is a place most of us don’t even know is there—it’s where we put the parts of us we repress and deny.</p>
<p>The authentic yearnings of ours that we’re in touch with—i.e. those that proved to be authentic during interrogation—were easy parts of our true selves to find in our subconscious, lying in plain sight, right below the surface of our consciousness. Even our conscious mind knows these yearnings well, because they frequently make their way upstairs into our thoughts. These are the parts of us we have a healthy relationship with.</p>
<p>But then there are the parts of you that weren’t living on your octopus where they’re supposed to be—instead, you found an imposter in their place. These lost parts of you are often incredibly hard to access, because they’ve been living deep in your subconscious, on a floor so low it’s almost not there at all. Almost.</p>
<p>Some parts of us are banished down on basement #3 because they’re extraordinarily painful for us to acknowledge or think about. Sometimes new parts of us are born only to be immediately locked up in prison as part of a denial of our own evolution—i.e. out of stubbornness. But there are other times when a part of us is in Denial Prison because someone <em>else</em> locked it up down there. In the case of your yearnings, some of them will have been put there by whatever masked intruder had been taking its place. If dad has successfully convinced you that you care deeply about having a prestigious career, he probably has also convinced you that the part of you that, deep down, really wants to be a carpenter isn’t really you and isn’t what you really want. At some point during your childhood, he threw your passion for carpentry into a dark, dank Denial Prison cell.</p>
<p>So let’s gather your courage and head down to the basement of the basement of the basement of your mind and see what we find.</p>

<p>Leave them for another time—right now, search for locked-away career-related yearnings. Maybe you’ll find a repressed passion to teach. Or a desire to be famous that your particular tribe has shamed you out of. Or a deep love of long blocks of free, open leisure time that your hornier, greedier teenage self kicked downstairs in favor of a raging ambition.</p>
<p>There will be certain parts of your authentic self you won’t be able to uncover in Denial Prison—it’s pretty dark down there. But be patient—now that you’ve done your audit and cleared space for them on your octopus, they may begin to emerge.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Priority Rankings</strong></span></p>
<p>The other part of our Yearning Octopus audit will address the hierarchy of your yearnings. Almost as important as the yearnings themselves is the priority they’re given. The hierarchy is easy to see because it’s revealed in your actions. You may like to think a desire to do something bold is high up on your hierarchy, but if you’re not currently working on something bold, it reveals that however important boldness is to you, something else—some source of fear or inertia in you—is currently being prioritized above it.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that a ranking of yearnings is also a ranking of fears. The octopus contains anything that could make you want or not want to pursue a certain career, and the reverse side of each yearning is its accompanying fear of the opposite. The reverse side of your yearning to be admired is a fear of embarrassment. If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you’ll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don’t seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it&#8217;s because you’re forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing. What looks like a determined drive for success, for example, might actually be someone running <em>away </em>from a negative self-image or trying to escape feelings like envy or under-appreciation. If your actions seem beholden to yearnings that you don’t believe you actually care that much about, you’re probably not looking closely enough at your fears.</p>
<p>With both yearnings and fears in mind, think about what your internal hierarchy might look like, and return that same important question: “Who made this order? Was it really me?”</p>
<p>For example, we’re often told to “follow our passion”—this is society saying “put your passion yearnings at the top of your hierarchy.” That’s a very specific instruction. Maybe that’s the right thing for you, but it also very well might not be. It’s something you need to independently evaluate.</p>
<p>To get this right, let’s try to do a fresh ranking, from first principles, based on who we really are, how we’ve evolved over time, and what really matters to us most, right now.</p>
<p>This isn’t about which yearnings or fears have the loudest voices or which fears are most palpable—if it were, you’d be letting your impulses take the wheel of your life. The person doing the ranking is <em>you</em>—the little center of consciousness reading this post who can observe your octopus and look at it objectively. This involves another kind of compromise. On one side, you’ll try to tap into all the wisdom you’ve accumulated throughout your life and make active decisions about values—about what you really believe is <em>important</em>. On the other side, it’s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sometimes you’ll have strong undeniable yearnings that you’re not super proud of—whether you like it or not, those are part of you, and when you neglect them, they may cause a continual stink and make you miserable. Creating your yearning hierarchy is a give and take between what’s important and what’s you. It’s probably a good goal to give higher priority to your more noble qualities, but it’s okay to throw a bone to some of your not-so-noble sides as well—depending on where you decide to draw the line. There’s a wisdom to knowing when to accept your not-so-noble side and when to reject it entirely.</p>
<p>To get all of this in order, we want a good system. You can play around with what works for you—I like the idea of a shelf:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6817" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="580" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png 943w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-300x218.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-768x557.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-600x435.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>This divides things into five categories. The absolutely highest priority inner drives get to go in the extra special non-negotiable bowl. The NN bowl is for yearnings <i>so </i>important to you that you want to essentially guarantee that they’ll happen—at the expense of all other yearnings, if necessary. This is why so many of history’s legends were famously single-minded—they had a very intense NN bowl yearning and it led them to world fame, often at the expense of relationships, balance, and health. The bowl is small because it should be used very sparingly—if at all. Like maybe only one thing gets it. Or <i>maybe </i>two or three. Too many things in the NN bowl cancels out its power, making that the same as having nothing in the bowl at all.<span class="m_1544476509806979791gmail-Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Your group of top shelf yearnings is mostly what will drive your career choices—but top shelf placement should also be doled out sparingly (that’s why it’s not a very large shelf). Shelf placement is as much about de-prioritizing as it is about prioritizing. You’re not just choosing which parts of you are the most important to make you happy, you’re choosing which parts of you to intentionally leave wanting or even directly opposed. No matter what your hierarchy looks like, some yearnings will be left feeling very unhappy and some fears will feel like they’re being continually assaulted. This is inevitable.</p>
<p>That’s why most yearnings should be on the middle shelf, the bottom shelf, or the trash can. The middle shelf is good for those not-so-noble qualities in you that you decide to accept. They deserve some of your attention. And they&#8217;ll often demand it—core parts of you won’t go quietly into non-prioritization, and they sometimes can really ruin your life if they’re neglected.</p>
<p>Most of the rest will end up on the bottom shelf. Putting a part of you on the bottom shelf is telling it, “I know you want these things, but for now, I’ve decided other things are more important. I promise to revisit you a little later, after I’ve gotten some more information, and if I change my mind, you’ll get a shelf upgrade then.” The best way to think of the bottom shelf is this: the more yearnings you can convince to accept a bottom shelf rating, the better the chances your top shelf and NN bowl yearnings have of getting what they want. Likewise, the fewer yearnings you put on the <em>top</em> shelf, the more likely those on the top shelf will be to thrive. Your time and energy are severely limited, so this is a zero-sum compromise. The amateur mistake is to be too liberal with the NN bowl and top shelf and too sparing with the large bottom shelf.</p>
<p>Then there’s the trash can, for the drives and fears you flat-out reject—those parts of you that fundamentally violate the person your wisest self wants to be. A good amount of inner conflict emerges from people’s trash cans, and trash can control is a major component of integrity and inner strength. But like the rest of your hierarchy decisions, your criteria for what qualifies as trash should be derived from your own deep thought, not from what others tell you is and is not trash.</p>
<p>As you go through this difficult prioritizing process—inevitably, at times, against the screaming protests of unhappily deprioritized yearnings—remember that you’re the only wise one in the room. Yearnings and fears are impatient and bad at seeing the big picture. Even a seemingly high-minded yearning, like those on the moral tentacle, can’t understand the complete picture in the way you can. Many of the people who have done wonders to make the world better got there on a path that started with selfish motives like wealth or personal fulfillment—motives their moral tentacle probably hated at first. The octopus won’t be the wise adult in the room—that’s your job.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6789" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="477" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png 1487w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-300x238.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-768x610.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-600x477.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, as we’ll discuss more later, this is not a permanent decision. It’s the opposite—it’s a rough draft written in light pencil. It’s a hypothesis that you’ll be able to test and then revise based on how actually living this hierarchy feels in practice.</p>
<p>Your Want Box is ready to go. Now let’s turn to your Reality Box.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>Deep Analysis, Part 2: Your Reality Box</strong></span></p>
<p>The Want Box deals with what you find desirable. The Reality Box deals with what’s <em>possible</em>.</p>
<p>But when we examined the Want Box, it became clear that it’s not necessarily based on what you actually want—it’s based on what you <em>think </em>you want—what you’re in the <em>habit </em>of wanting.</p>
<p>The Reality Box is the same deal. It doesn’t show you reality, it shows your best crack at what reality might be—your <em>perception </em>of reality.</p>
<p>The goal of self-reflection is to bring both of these boxes as close to accuracy as possible. We want our perceived yearnings to be a true reflection of our authentic inner selves, and we want our beliefs about what’s possible to come close to mirroring what’s actually possible. For our Want Box audit, we looked under the hood of the Want Box and found its settings—your yearnings and fears. When we open the hood of your Reality Box, we see a group of <em>beliefs</em>.</p>
<p>When it comes to your career possibilities, you’re dealing with two sets of beliefs: beliefs about the world and beliefs about your own potential. For a career option to qualify for your Reality Box, your potential in that career area has to measure up to the objective difficulty of achieving success in that area.</p>
<p>Us being us, we’re probably pretty bad at assessing either side of this comparison accurately.</p>
<p>I don’t know how you think about career path difficulty, but in my experience, people often see it like this:</p>
<p>There are traditional careers—stuff like medicine or law or teaching or a corporate ladder, etc.—and these careers have predictable, set paths. If you’re decently smart and work hard, you’ll end up in a successful, stable situation.</p>
<p>Then there are less traditional careers—the arts, entrepreneurship, non-profit work, politics, etc.—and these are wildcards. Success and stability are no guarantee, and to reach great heights, it’s either a lottery ticket game of luck, a genetic lottery game of innate talent, or some combination of the two.</p>
<p>These are perfectly reasonable assumptions—if you live in 1952. Your beliefs about the world of careers and about what it takes to succeed need just as thorough an unmasking as your yearnings did—and I suspect that behind most of them, you’ll find big, fat conventional wisdom. You might first pull off the mask of one of your beliefs and find your parents or your friends or your college career coach—but if you keep going and pull on <em>their </em>face, you’ll usually see that it’s also a mask, and conventional wisdom is there hiding behind it. A general conception, a common opinion, an oft-cited statistic<a href="#footnote-7-6721" id="note-7-6721" rel="footnote">7</a>—none of which have actually been verified by you, but all of which are treated as gospel by society.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s world goes through dramatic changes each decade, which usually leaves conventional wisdom wildly outdated. But we&#8217;re wired for a more ancient world where almost nothing ever changed, so we all reason like cooks and treat conventional wisdom as equivalent to truth.</p>
<p>These problems then extend to how we view our own potential. When you overrate the impact of innate talent on how people fare in their careers—and you also conflate talent and skill level—it won’t leave you feeling great about your chances at many paths. Because we better understand the trajectory of traditional careers, we’re less prone to do this with them. A first-year medical student sees an experienced surgeon at work and thinks, “I can get there one day—just need to do about 20 years of hard work.&#8221; But when a young artist or entrepreneur or software engineer looks at the equivalent of the experienced surgeon in their field, they’re more likely to think, “Wow look how talented they are—I’m nowhere near that good,” and get all hopeless. There’s also the other common notion, that people who thrive in non-traditional careers had some “big break” at some point, like hitting a lucky scratch card jackpot—and I don’t know many people who want to risk their careers on scratch cards.</p>
<p>These are only a few examples of the slew of delusions and misconceptions we tend to have about how great careers happen. So let’s brainstorm how it might actually work:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>The Career Landscape</strong></span></p>
<p>I have no idea, mostly. And I think most people have no idea. Things are just changing too quickly.</p>
<p>But that’s kind of the key point. If you can figure out how to get a reasonably accurate picture of the real career landscape out there, you have a massive edge over everyone else, most of whom will be using conventional wisdom as their instruction booklet.</p>
<p>First, there’s the broad landscape—the set of all the jobs someone could possibly have in today’s society. My current job description is: “Writer of 8,000-to-40,000-word articles about a bunch of different topics, with cursing and stick figures, on a remarkably sporadic schedule.” Think conventional wisdom has any job openings for me with that description? The landscape today is made up of thousands of options—some 40 years old, some made possible only three months ago because of the advent of some new technology—and the way things work today, if there’s an option you want that’s not already out there, you can probably create it for yourself. Pretty stressful, but also incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>Then, there’s each specific career path. A career path is like a game board. The conventional wisdom bookshelf contains instruction booklets for only a small fraction of today’s available game boards—and those that it does have usually tell you how that game was played in the past, even though the current game board has evolved significantly into something with new kinds of opportunities and different rules and loopholes. When you consider a career path today, to make an accurate assessment of what the path looks like and what kinds of strength-weakness profiles it favors, you have to understand what that career’s current game board looks like. Otherwise, it’s like trying to evaluate your chances of being a professional basketball player based on your height and strength without realizing that, say, basketball has evolved and is now played on oversize courts that contain 10 different 7-foot hoops, and the current game favors speed over height and strength.</p>
<p>This is promising news. There are likely dozens of awesome career paths that beautifully match your natural strengths, <em>and </em>it’s likely that most other people trying to succeed on those paths are playing with an outdated rulebook and strategy guide. If you simply understand what the game board really looks like and play by modern rules, you have a huge advantage.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Your Potential</strong></span></p>
<p>And this brings us to you and your particular strengths. Not only do we assess our strengths based on the wrong game boards (like in our basketball example)—even when we have the <em>right </em>game board in mind, we&#8217;re often bad at identifying the real strengths that that game calls for.</p>
<p>When assessing your chances on a certain career path, the key question is:</p>
<p><em>With enough time, could you get good enough at this game to potentially reach whatever your definition of success is in that career?</em></p>
<p>I like to view this journey to “good enough at the game to succeed” as a distance. The distance starts with where you are now—point A—and ends with you reaching your definition of success, which we can draw with a star.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6766" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="196" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1.png 958w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1-300x65.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1-768x168.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1-600x131.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>The length of the distance depends on where point A is (how far along you are at the current moment) and where the star is (how lofty your definition of success is).</p>
<p>So if you’re a college graduate who majored in computer science and your career goal is to be a middle-of-the-ladder engineer at Google, your distance might look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6767" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="196" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1.png 958w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1-300x65.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1-768x168.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1-600x131.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>But if you’ve never done any kind of computer science before, and your career goal is to be the top engineer at Google, you’ve got a much longer road ahead:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6768" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="196" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1.png 958w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1-300x65.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1-768x168.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1-600x131.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>If your goal is to create the new Google, the road gets much, much longer.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6791" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2.png" alt="" width="900" height="196" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2.png 958w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2-300x65.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2-768x168.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2-600x131.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>At this point, conventional wisdom might emerge as a voice in your head and point out that simply getting good enough at a certain skill doesn’t actually guarantee success—you might reach the star on a career path and still find that you haven’t “made it” yet.</p>
<p>That’s mostly wrong, because it&#8217;s misunderstanding the star. The star isn’t about a particular skill level—e.g. coding ability or acting skills or business savvy—it’s about the entire <em>game</em>. In traditional careers, the games tend to be more straightforward—if you want to be a top surgeon, and you get incredibly good at surgery, you’ve probably hit your star and you’ll have your career. But the game boards in less traditional careers often involve many more factors. Reaching the “I want to be a famous actor” star doesn’t simply mean getting as good at acting as Morgan Freeman, it means getting as good at the entire actor <em>game </em>as most movie stars get by the time they break through. Acting ability is only one piece of that puzzle—you also need a knack for getting yourself in front of people with power, a shrewdness for personal branding, an insane amount of optimism, a ridiculous amount of hustle and persistence, etc. If you get good enough at that <em>whole </em>game—every component of it—your chances of becoming an A-list movie star are actually pretty high. <em>That’s </em>what hitting the star means.</p>
<p>But conventional wisdom doesn’t get how non-traditional careers work—it only thinks in terms of a narrow aspect of success: talent and hard work. When career paths have game boards with much more going on, conventional wisdom just throws its hands up and calls it “luck.” To conventional wisdom, becoming a movie star requires some talent, but mostly, hitting a rare scratch ticket jackpot.</p>
<p>So how do you figure out your chances of getting to any particular star? It’s all about a simple formula:</p>
<p>Distance = Speed x Time.</p>
<p>In our case, the more apt wording might be:</p>
<p>Progress = Pace x Persistence.</p>
<p>Your outlook on any career quest depends on A) the pace at which you’ll be able to improve at playing that career&#8217;s “game” and B) the amount of time you’re willing to persist in chasing that star. Let’s talk about both of these:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Pace</strong></span></p>
<p>What makes someone slower or faster at improving at a career game? I’d say it comes down to three factors:</p>
<p><strong>Your level of chefness. </strong>As we discussed earlier, chefs look at the world with fresh eyes and build conclusions based on what they observe and what they’ve experienced. Cooks arrive at conclusions by following someone else’s recipe—in the case of careers, the recipe is usually conventional wisdom. Careers are complex games that almost everyone starts off bad at—then the chefs improve rapidly through a continual loop…</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6796" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="313" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png 1639w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-300x268.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-768x687.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-600x537.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a></p>
<p>…while cooks improve at a snail’s pace, because their strategy is just following a recipe which itself barely changes. What’s more, in a world where career games are constantly evolving and morphing, the chef’s tactics can evolve in real time and keep up. Meanwhile, the cook’s recipe just grows more and more outdated—a problem they remain oblivious to. This is why I’m pretty convinced that at least for less traditional careers, your level of chefness is the single most important factor in determining your pace of improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Your work ethic. </strong>This one is obvious. Someone who works on their career 60 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, is going to move down the path almost four times faster than someone who works 20 hours a week, 40 weeks a year. Someone who chooses a balanced lifestyle will move slower than a single-minded workaholic. Someone with a propensity towards laziness or procrastination is going to lose a lot of ground to someone who’s good at putting in consistent work days. Someone who frequently breaks from work to daydream or pick up their phone is going to get less done in each work hour than someone who practices deep focus.</p>
<p><strong>Your natural abilities. </strong>Talent does matter. Smarter, more talented people will improve at a game at a faster rate than less naturally gifted people. But intelligence and talent are only two types of natural ability that come into play here. Cleverness and savvy matter too, and those qualities don’t always correlate with raw intelligence. Depending on the type of career, social skills can be critically important as well. In many careers, likable (or subtly manipulative) people have a big advantage over less likable people—and those who enjoy socializing will put in more people hours over time, and build deeper relationships, than antisocial types.</p>
<p>Other things, like existing connections, existing resources, and existing skills matter, of course, but they’re not components of pace—they’re part of the location of point A.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Persistence</strong></span></p>
<p>When I say persistence, I&#8217;m referring to long-term persistence (as opposed to day-to-day work ethic). Persistence is simpler than pace. The more years you’re willing to commit to chasing a star, the farther along the road towards the star you’ll get. A car going 30 mph that quits driving after 15 minutes gets a lot less far than a car that drives 10 mph for two hours.</p>
<p>And this is why persistence is so important. Someone who has decided they’re only willing to give a dream career a shot for three years before they’ll go for their fallback plan has essentially disqualified themselves from a chance at their dreams. It doesn’t matter how awesome you are—if you&#8217;ll give up after two or three years of not breaking through, you’re unlikely to succeed. A few years is just not enough time to traverse the typically long distances it takes to get to the raddest success stars, no matter how impressive your pace.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Your Real Strengths and W</strong><strong>eaknesses</strong></span></p>
<p>With our pace-times-persistence equation in mind, let’s revisit the concept of strengths and weaknesses. It’s not that &#8220;strengths and weaknesses&#8221; is a bad concept—it’s that we think about it all wrong. When we list our strengths, we tend to list our areas of existing skill more than anything else. Instead, strengths should be all about pace and persistence qualities. Originality or lack thereof should be a critical component of the discussion, making qualities like agility and humility (trademark chef traits) notable strengths, and qualities like stubbornness<a href="#footnote-8-6721" id="note-8-6721" rel="footnote">8</a> or intellectual laziness (classic cook traits) important weaknesses. The subtleties of work ethic, like a knack for deep focus or a propensity to procrastinate, should also be a major part of the discussion, as should natural abilities beyond talent, like savvy and likability. Qualities related to persistence, like resilience and determination and patience, should be thought of as promising strengths, while a social tentacle clamoring to appear successful as quickly as possible should be viewed as a bright red flag.</p>
<p>Most importantly, these items shouldn’t be discussed as a snapshot of where they are now, but rather in terms of your <em>potential for improvement</em> in each of them. If you handed 25-year-old Michael Jordan a basketball for the first time, he’d suck. But calling basketball a “weakness” of his would be getting it very wrong. Instead, you’d want to watch him practice over the next six weeks and evaluate the slope of his improvement. This lesson applies to specific skills—but most general pace and persistence qualities can <em>also</em> be worked on and improved if you focus on them.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Filling in the Reality Box</strong></span></p>
<p>Your true Reality Box would literally include all career paths for which you think a highly improved version of yourself could, with an entire lifetime of effort, reach the minimum star you’d be comfortable defining as success. This would be an impossibly big list, only ruling out paths that are clearly far too long for you to traverse at your maximum possible pace on the path (like me chasing a career as an Olympic figure skater). But it’s still useful to pause for a minute and reflect on the vast extent of your full Reality Box—just acknowledging how many options are truly open to you can put you in the right mindset.<a href="#footnote-9-6721" id="note-9-6721" rel="footnote">9</a>
<p>So to be a bit more efficient, let’s worry about the parts of the Reality Box that might actually end up in your Option Pool (the middle of the Venn diagram where the Want and Reality Boxes overlap). To complete our Reality Box audit with that caveat, we need to evaluate:</p>
<p><strong>1) The general landscape. </strong>Take our best crack at evaluating the world’s current career landscape—the full range of options available (or create-able).</p>
<p><strong>2) Specific game boards.</strong> For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career&#8217;s current game board—the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc.</p>
<p><strong>3) Starting point.</strong> For those paths, evaluate your starting point, based on your current skills, resources, and connections relevant to that field.</p>
<p><strong>4) Success point.</strong> Think about end points and where on each line your star should be placed. Ask yourself what’s the minimum level of success you’d need to achieve in order to feel happy about having chosen that career path.</p>
<p><strong>5) Your pace.</strong> Make an initial estimate for what your pace of improvement might be on these various game boards, based on your current pace-related strengths and how much you think you can improve at each of them (in other words, how much your speed might be able to <em>accelerate</em>).</p>
<p><strong>6) Your level of persistence.</strong> Evaluate the amount of time you think you’ll be willing to put into each of these respective paths.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s just math. You take your game board and make it a line, you plot starting points and success stars that together generate the various distances in front of you, and for each, you multiply your pace by your level of persistence. If it seems like the product of your pace and persistence for a given career path might be able to measure up to the path’s total length, that career lands in your Reality Box. Of course, it&#8217;s impossible to get exact values for any of the above factors, but it&#8217;s good to at least know the equation you&#8217;re working with.</p>
<p>A from-first-principles Reality Box audit may bring some overly optimistic people down to Earth, but I suspect that for most, an audit will leave them feeling like they have a lot more options than they realized, empowering them to set their sights on a bolder direction.</p>
<p>A good Reality Box reflection warrants yet another Want Box reflection. Reframing a bunch of career paths in your mind will affect your level of yearning for some of them. One career may seem less appealing after reminding yourself that it will entail thousands of hours of networking or multiple decades of pre-success struggle. Another may seem less daunting after changing your mind about how much luck is actually involved. There will be other career paths you hadn’t considered wanting because you hadn’t considered them as real options, but some deep reflection has opened your mind to them.</p>
<p>This brings us to the end of our long, two-part deep dive. After a fairly exhausting box-auditing process, we can return to our Venn<a href="#footnote-10-6721" id="note-10-6721" rel="footnote">10</a> diagram.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6771" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1.png" alt="" width="400" height="255" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1.png 1586w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1-300x191.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1-768x490.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1-600x383.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Assuming some things have changed, you have a new Option Pool to look at—a new list of options on the table that seem both desirable to your high-priority rankings and possible to achieve. We’re ready now to return to where we were before we started our analysis: the present moment. With these options in front of us, we&#8217;re ready to lift our heads up out of analysis and look forward into the future.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>Connecting the Dots into the Future</strong></span></p>
<p>It’s time to bring back your Career Plans map that I made you put down at the beginning of the post—the one with the arrow or the question mark. If there had been a clear arrow on your map before your audit, check out your new Option Pool. Given everything you’ve reflected upon, does your current career plan still qualify to be there? If so, congrats—you’re ahead of most of us.</p>
<p>If not, well that’s shitty news, but it’s also good news. Remember, going from a false arrow to a question mark is always major progress in life.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-2-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6803" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-2-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="775" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-2-2.png 1135w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-2-2-300x291.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-2-2-768x744.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-2-2-600x581.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>And actually, a new question mark implies having made the key cliff jump on <em>two</em> roller coasters: getting to know yourself and getting to know the world. Major step in the right direction. Cross out the arrow and join the question mark crowd.</p>
<p>Now the question mark crowd has a tough choice. You gotta pick one of the arrows in the Option Pool.</p>
<p>It’s a tough choice—but it should be <em>way less tough </em>than it is. Here’s why:</p>
<p>Careers used to be kind of like a 40-year tunnel. You picked your tunnel, and once you were in, that was that. You worked in that profession for 40 years or so before the tunnel spit you out on the other side into your retirement.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6787" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png" alt="" width="700" height="541" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png 1100w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-300x232.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-768x593.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-600x464.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>The truth is, careers have probably never really functioned like 40-year-tunnels, they just seemed that way. At best, traditional careers of the past played out <em>kind </em>of like tunnels.</p>
<p>Today’s careers—especially the less traditional ones—are really really not like tunnels. But crusty old conventional wisdom has a lot of us still viewing things that way, which makes the already hard job of making big career path choices much harder.</p>
<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, it causes an identity crisis in anyone who doesn’t feel sure of who exactly they are and who they’ll want to be decades from now—which is most sane people. It enhances the delusion that what we do for work is a synonym for who we are, making a question mark on your map seem like an existential disaster.</p>
<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, the stakes to make the right choice seem so high that it explodes the feeling of tyranny of choice. For perfectionist types especially, this can be utterly paralyzing.</p>
<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, you lose the courage to make a career switch, even when your soul is begging for it. It makes switching careers feel incredibly risky and embarrassing, and it suggests that someone who does so is a failure. It also makes all kinds of multi-faceted, vibrant, mid-career people feel like they’re too old to make a bold switch or start a whole new path afresh.</p>
<p>But conventional wisdom still tells many of us that careers are tunnels. As the icing on its shit cake—on top of helping us yearn for things we don’t actually want, deny yearnings that we feel deep down, fear things that aren’t dangerous, and believe things about the world and our potential that aren’t accurate—conventional wisdom tells us that careers are a tunnel to help us daunt the shit out of ourselves unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Today’s career landscape isn&#8217;t a lineup of tunnels, it’s a massive, impossibly complex, rapidly changing science laboratory. Today’s people aren’t synonymous with what they do—they’re impossibly complex, rapidly changing scientists. And today’s career isn’t a tunnel, or a box, or an identity label—it’s a long series of science experiments.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a> life to connecting the dots, pointing out that while it’s easy to look at your past and see how the dots connected to lead you to where you are, it’s basically impossible in life to connect the dots forwards.</p>
<p>If you look at the biographies of your heroes, you’ll see that their paths look a lot more like a long series of connected dots than a straight and predictable tunnel. If you look at yourself and your friends, you’ll probably see the same trend—according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420130623/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm">data</a>, the median time a young person stays in a given job is only 3 years (older people spend a longer time on each dot, but not that much longer—10.4 years on average).</p>
<p>So seeing your career as a series of dots isn’t a mental trick to help you make decisions—it’s an accurate depiction of what’s actually happening. And seeing your career as a tunnel isn’t just unproductive—it’s delusional.</p>
<p>Likewise, you&#8217;re limited to focusing mainly on the next dot on your path—because it’s the only dot you <em>can </em>figure out. You don’t have to worry about dot #4 because you can’t anyway—you’re literally not qualified to do so.</p>
<p>By the time dot #4 rolls around, you will have learned stuff about yourself you don’t know now. You’ll also have changed from who you are now, and your Yearning Octopus will reflect those changes. You’ll know a lot more than you currently do about the career landscape and the specific game boards you’re interested in, and you’ll have become a much better game player. And of course, that landscape—and those game boards—will have themselves evolved.</p>
<p>The fantastic website <a href="https://80000hours.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80,000 Hours</a> (which exists to help young, talented people work through their career choices) has compiled a lot of data to back this up: data on the fact that <a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/02/we-change-more-than-we-expect-so-keep-your-options-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’ll change</a>, that <a href="https://80000hours.org/2015/02/which-careers-will-be-automated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world will change</a>, and that <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you’ll only learn with time what you’re actually good at</a>. Popular psychologist Dan Gilbert also eloquently <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describes</a> just how bad we are at predicting what will make us happy in the future.</p>
<p>Pretending you can figure out what dot #2 or #4 or #8 should be now is laughable. Future dots are the worry of a future, wiser you living in a future world. So let’s focus on dot #1.</p>
<p>If we’re thinking of ourselves as scientists and of society as a science lab, we should think of your current freshly revised Want-Reality Venn Diagram as nothing more than an early, rough hypothesis. Dot #1 is your chance to test it out.</p>
<p>Hypothesis testing is intuitive in the dating world. If a friend were toiling over what kind of person she wants to marry but never went out with anyone, you’d tell her, “You can’t figure this out on your couch—you’ve gotta start going on dates, and that’ll teach you what you want in a partner.” If that friend then went on a solid first date and returned home to toil for hours about whether or not this new person was The One, you’d again have to correct her. You’d say, “There’s no way you can know that from just one date! You have to get some experience dating this person to learn what you need to learn to make that decision.”</p>
<p>We can all agree that this hypothetical friend is pretty nuts and is lacking a fundamental understanding of how you find a happy relationship. So let’s not be like her when it comes to picking our career. Dot #1 is a chill situation—it’s just a first date.</p>
<p>This is awesome news—because it makes it a lot less scary to draw an arrow on your map if it’s only an arrow to dot #1 of your future. The real cause of tyranny of choice is accurately seeing the sheer number of options you have in today’s world while delusionally seeing those careers as the 40-year tunnels of yesterday’s world. That’s a lethal combo. Reframing your next major career decision as a far lower-stakes choice makes the number of options exciting, not stressful.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s all great in theory. But now comes the hard part.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Making Your Move</strong></span></p>
<p>You’ve reflected and reflected and reflected and weighed and measured and predicted and considered. You’ve chosen a dot and drawn an arrow. And now you have to actually make the move.</p>
<p>We’re super bad at this. We’re frightened people. We don’t like icky things and making a bold, real-life step is icky. If there’s any ounce of procrastination susceptibility in us, here’s where it’ll show itself.</p>
<p>The Yearning Octopus can help. As we discussed earlier, your behavior at any given point simply displays the configuration of your octopus. If you’ve decided on a life step and you can’t quite take it, it’s because the parts of you that don’t want to make a move are ranked higher in your subconscious than the parts of you that do. Your conscious mind may have tried to assign lower shelf ratings to the parts of your octopus that lean towards inertia, but your yearnings have rebelled. You’re a CEO not in control of their staff.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, think like a kindergarten teacher. In your class, a faction of the 5-year-olds is rebelling against your wishes. What do you do?</p>
<p>Go talk to the 5-year-olds that are causing the trouble. They’re unpleasant, defiant simpletons, but they can still be reasoned with. Talk to them about why you’ve ranked them lower than others in the octopus hierarchy. Describe to them the insights you gained from your Reality Box reflection. Remind them about how connecting the dots works and about the chillness of dot #1. You’re the teacher—figure it out.</p>
<p>The older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life’s struggle. The world is easy—<em>you’re </em>difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you’ve uncovered your new #1 priority—becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know.</p>
<p>If your inner analysis does call for a career leap to a new dot, I hope that at some point, you’re able to make the jump.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>After the Move</strong></span></p>
<p>Jumping to a new dot is a liberating feeling, usually side by side with some substantial internal havoc.</p>
<p>First of all, for a while at least, you’ll probably suck at what you’re doing on your new dot. While your wise self will know that’s exactly how it should be, your less wise selves will go into full existential meltdown mode. All of the fears you so thoughtfully deprioritized in your octopus ranking will think someone is murdering them and they’ll start trying to call 911. The yearnings you did prioritize won’t be feeling much gratification yet, and they’ll wonder if they were wrong all along about what they thought they wanted. The yearnings you didn’t prioritize will get out the guitar and start singing love songs for the greener-seeming grass you deprived them of. It won’t be much fun.</p>
<p>Even if things do go well, you’ll be quickly reminded of the fact that the Yearning Octopus is a generally unhappy creature. Core pieces of the octopus will feel neglected or even assaulted, and every day that goes by, you’ll be bearing the opportunity cost of the paths you were considering but chose not to walk down—the versions of you in parallel universes where you made other choices. You’ll think about their hypothetical advancement in the world and worry about what you may have passed up.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6788" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="631" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png 1200w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-300x237.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-768x605.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-600x473.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>As you get wiser, you’ll learn to view a largely unhappy octopus with acceptance. You’ll let it whine and get good at tuning it out, knowing that it’s whining in the exact way you planned for it to be.</p>
<p>The whining octopus is a reminder of why pure, elated happiness is never a reasonable goal. The times you feel pure happiness are temporary, drug-induced delusions—like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship or new job or the high following a long-awaited success. Those moments are the perfect golf shots of a mediocre golfer’s outing—they’re awesome, and you should enjoy the shit out of them—but they’re not the new normal, and they never will be.</p>
<p>A better goal is contentment: the satisfying feeling that you’re currently taking the best crack you can at a good life path; that what you’re working on might prove to be a piece of an eventual puzzle you can feel really proud of. Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise.</p>
<p>People talk about being present in the moment, but there’s also the broader concept of macro-presence: feeling broadly present in your own life. If you’re on a career dot that, when you’re being really honest with yourself, feels right, you get to stop thinking and stop planning for a while and just dig in. You’ll come back to the big picture later—for now, you can put the macro picture aside, put your head down, and dedicate all of your energy to the present. For a while, you can just <em>live</em>.</p>
<p>These moments don’t always last that long, so sink your teeth in. Put everything you’ve got into the dot you’ve chosen. As far as you know, you might be Michael Jordan holding his first basketball, so start playing.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>The Next Dot?</strong></span></p>
<p>At some point, your good feelings about the macro picture may sour. And when they do, you’ll have to get back into analysis mode and figure out what, in particular, is causing the restlessness.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the macro mission won’t be the problem. It’ll be that the chef in you has decided that the mission itself calls for a strategic dot jump. In these cases, jumping dots isn’t a release of persistence but the <em>stuff </em>of persistence. This is the <em>mission-enhancing</em> type of dot jump.</p>
<p>Other times, you’ll feel a darker kind of restlessness—the suspicion that you may need to change up the macro mission. When this happens, you’ll have to figure out if that feeling is emerging from the wise parts of you or simply from your restless, deprioritized yearnings. A <em>mission-changing </em>dot jump may be in order, but depending on which parts of you are asking for it, it may also be the wrong move.</p>
<p>In these moments, it’s important to consider where you tend to be on this spectrum:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6775" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png" alt="" width="900" height="297" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png 900w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-300x99.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-768x253.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-600x198.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>The people on the left side of this spectrum are jump-shy. The cement-footed. Their pitfall is staying way too long in the wrong things. The people on the right are jump-happy—the wing-footed—and they have the opposite pitfall: they’re quick quitters.<a href="#footnote-11-6721" id="note-11-6721" rel="footnote">11</a> (You should be especially wary of cement feet—psychologists believe that people at the end of their lives are most likely to regret living by inertia: a commonly voiced regret is <a href="https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/12/top-career-regrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“I wish I had quit earlier,”</a> and the most common advice of the elderly is, “<a href="https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/04/most-important-life-lesson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don’t stay in a job you dislike.</a>&#8220;)</p>
<p>This is why these internal frameworks are important. They give you the ability to analyze the source of your impulses. In our example, the question is whether your impulse to jump missions is the result of genuine evolution or quick-quitter bias. So think about your diagram. Is your restlessness just the expected incessant whining of an octopus still correctly configured? The weariness from a long trudge on what’s still the right path for you? Or have you learned new information about yourself or the world during the trudge that has corrected some off-base initial assumptions? Or maybe something is fundamentally evolving—some blue or yellow <em>loop </em>activity:</p>

<p>If you feel that things have genuinely changed, you may decide to zoom out even further and think about the big red loop, which deals with fundamentally changing your mission:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-6805" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png" alt="" width="900" height="790" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png 2500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-300x263.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-768x674.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-600x527.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>If a career is like connecting the dots, we should probably rank “getting wise about dot-jumping” pretty high on our to-do list. The best place to start is by looking at your own past. Studying your own past decisions, with the flashlight of hindsight and accumulated wisdom, is like an athlete studying game tape.</p>
<p>Looking at my own past, I can see a lot of dot jumps (or, while I was still in school, career plan adjustments), and some of them look pretty unwise in retrospect. But the clearer a picture I can see of my past bad decisions and the thought patterns and behavioral habits that built them, the less likely I’ll be to repeat them in the future.</p>
<p>Remembering that you’re kind of dumb is also a critical humbling exercise. The insecurity of humility doesn’t feel very good, and the burden of having to continually invent your own life map is never easy—but insecurity and difficulty are the feelings of driving your own ship. It’s when we feel too good that we run the risk of becoming overconfident, intellectually complacent, and set in our ways. It’s exactly when we think we have life all figured out that we end up losing our way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>Over the course of your life, your good and bad decisions will collaborate to forge your unique life path. Often on this blog, I’ve written about how irrational our fears can be and how badly they can hold us back. But we should probably embrace the fear of end-of-life regret.</p>
<p>I’ve thankfully never been on anything that felt like a deathbed, but it seems like there’s something about the end of life that lets people see things with clear eyes. It seems like facing death makes all of those voices in your head who aren’t actually you melt away, leaving your little authentic self standing there all alone, in reflection. I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to live—the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious.</p>
<p>My own psyche seems to back this up—looking back on my path so far, the mistakes that bother me most are the ones that happened because someone else took the wheel of my head and overruled the quiet, insecure voice of my authentic self—the mistakes that I knew at the time, deep down, were wrong. My goal for the future isn&#8217;t to avoid mistakes, it&#8217;s for the mistakes I do make to be my own.</p>
<p>That’s why I went through such an excruciatingly rigorous analysis in this post. I think this is one of those few topics in life that’s worth it. Other voices will never stop fiercely trying to live your life for you—you owe it to that little insecure character in the very center of your consciousness to get this right.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">_______________________</p>
<p>Last month, I got a phone call.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6304" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Call-1.png" alt="" width="603" height="385" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Call-1.png 1800w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Call-1-300x192.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Call-1-768x491.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Call-1-600x383.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></p>
<p>Okay maybe that&#8217;s not exactly how it happened, and maybe those weren&#8217;t his exact words. But after learning about the new company Elon Musk was starting, I&#8217;ve come to realize that that&#8217;s exactly what he&#8217;s trying to do.</p>
<p>When I wrote about <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla</a> and <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpaceX</a>, I learned that you can only fully wrap your head around certain companies by zooming both way, way in <em>and</em> way, way out. In, on the technical challenges facing the engineers, out on the existential challenges facing our species. In on a snapshot of the world right now, out on the big story of how we got to this moment and what our far future could look like.</p>
<p>Not only is Elon’s new venture—Neuralink—the same type of deal, but six weeks after first learning about the company, I’m convinced that it somehow manages to eclipse Tesla and SpaceX in both the boldness of its engineering undertaking and the grandeur of its mission. The other two companies aim to redefine what future humans will do—Neuralink wants to redefine what future humans will <em>be</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>The mind-bending <em>bigness </em>of Neuralink’s mission, combined with the labyrinth of impossible complexity that is the human brain, made this the hardest set of concepts yet to fully wrap my head around—but it also made it the most exhilarating when, with enough time spent zoomed on both ends, it all finally <em>clicked</em>. I feel like I took a time machine to the future, and I’m here to tell you that it’s even weirder than we expect.</p>
<p>But before I can bring you in the time machine to show you what I found, we need to get in our zoom machine—because as I learned the hard way, Elon’s wizard hat plans cannot be properly understood until your head’s in the right place.</p>
<p>So wipe your brain clean of what it thinks it knows about itself and its future, put on soft clothes, and let’s jump into the vortex.</p>

<p>The problem is that no one had any nerves. Without nerves, you can&#8217;t move, or think, or process information of any kind. So you just had to kind of exist and wait there until you died.</p>
<p>But then came the jellyfish.</p>

<p>The jellyfish was the first animal to figure out that nerves were an obvious thing to make sure you had, and it had the world&#8217;s first nervous system—a nerve net.</p>

<p>The jellyfish&#8217;s nerve net allowed it to collect important information from the world around it—like where there were objects, predators, or food—and pass that information along, through a big game of telephone, to all parts of its body. Being able to receive and process information meant that the jellyfish could actually react to changes in its environment in order to increase the odds of life going well, rather than just floating aimlessly and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>A little later, a new animal came around who had an even cooler idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flatworm-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6249" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flatworm-1.png" alt="" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flatworm-1.png 900w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flatworm-1-300x225.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flatworm-1-768x576.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/flatworm-1-600x450.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>The flatworm figured out that you could get a lot more done if there was someone in the nervous system who was in charge of everything—a nervous system boss. The boss lived in the flatworm&#8217;s head and had a rule that all nerves in the body had to report any new information directly to him. So instead of arranging themselves in a net shape, the flatworm&#8217;s nervous system all revolved around a central highway of messenger nerves that would pass messages back and forth between the boss and everyone else:</p>

<p>The flatworm&#8217;s boss-highway system was the world&#8217;s first central nervous system, and the boss in the flatworm&#8217;s head was the world&#8217;s first brain.</p>
<p>The idea of a nervous system boss quickly caught on with others, and soon, there were thousands of species on Earth with brains.</p>
<p>As time passed and Earth&#8217;s animals started inventing intricate new body systems, the bosses got busier.</p>

<p>A little while later came the arrival of mammals. For the Millennials of the Animal Kingdom, life was complicated. Yes, their hearts needed to beat and their lungs needed to breathe, but mammals were about a lot more than survival functions—they were in touch with complex feelings like love, anger, and fear.</p>
<p>For the reptilian brain, which had only had to deal with reptiles and other simpler creatures so far, mammals were just&#8230;a lot. So a second boss developed in mammals to pair up with the reptilian brain and take care of all of these new needs—the world&#8217;s first limbic system.</p>

<p>Over the next 100 million years, the lives of mammals grew more and more complex, and one day, the two bosses noticed a new resident in the cockpit with them.</p>

<p>What appeared to be a random infant was actually the early version of the neocortex, and though he didn&#8217;t say much at first, as evolution gave rise to primates and then great apes and then early hominids, this new boss grew from a baby into a child and eventually into a teenager with his own idea of how things should be run.</p>

<p>The new boss&#8217;s ideas turned out to be really helpful, and he became the hominid&#8217;s go-to boss for things like tool-making, hunting strategy, and cooperation with other hominids.</p>
<p>Over the next few million years, the new boss grew older and wiser, and his ideas kept getting better. He figured out how to not be naked. He figured out how to control fire. He learned how to make a spear.</p>

<p>But his coolest trick was <em>thinking</em>. He turned each human&#8217;s head into a little world of its own, making humans the first animal that could think complex thoughts, reason through decisions, and make long-term plans.</p>
<p>And then, maybe about 100,000 years ago, he came up with a breakthrough.</p>

<p>The human brain had advanced to the point where it could understand that even though the sound &#8220;rock&#8221; was not <em>itself</em> a rock, it could be used as a <em>symbol</em> of a rock—it was a sound that <em>referred</em> to a rock. The early human had invented language.</p>
<p>Soon there were words for all kinds of things, and by 50,000 BC, humans were speaking in full, complex language with each other.</p>
<p>The neocortex had turned humans into magicians. Not only had he made the human head a wondrous internal ocean of complex thoughts, his latest breakthrough had found a way to translate those thoughts into a symbolic set of sounds and send them vibrating through the air into the heads of other humans, who could then decode the sounds and absorb the embedded idea into their own internal thought oceans. The human neocortex had been thinking about things for a long time—and he finally had someone to talk about it all with.</p>
<p>A neocortex party ensued. Neocortexes—fine—neocortices shared everything with each other—stories from their past, funny jokes they had thought of, opinions they had formed, plans for the future.</p>
<p>But most useful was sharing what they had <em>learned</em>. If one human learned through trial and error that a certain type of berry led to 48 hours of your life being run by diarrhea, they could use language to share the hard-earned lesson with the rest of their tribe, like photocopying the lesson and handing it to everyone else. Tribe members would then use language to pass along that lesson to their children, and their children would pass it to their own children. Rather than the same mistake being made again and again by many different people, one person&#8217;s &#8220;stay away from that berry&#8221; wisdom could travel through space and time to protect everyone else from having their bad experience.</p>
<p>The same thing would happen when one human figured out a new clever trick. One unusually-intelligent hunter particularly attuned to both star constellations and the annual migration patterns of wildebeest<a href="#footnote-1-6120" id="note-1-6120" rel="footnote">1</a> herds could share a system he devised that used the night sky to determine exactly how many days remained until the herd would return. Even though very few hunters would have been able to come up with that system on their own, through word-of-mouth, all future hunters in the tribe would now benefit from the ingenuity of one ancestor, with that one hunter&#8217;s crowning discovery serving as every future hunter&#8217;s <em>starting point</em> of knowledge.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s say this knowledge advancement makes the hunting season more efficient, which gives tribe members more time to work on their weapons—which allows one extra-clever hunter a few generations later to discover a method for making lighter, denser spears that can be thrown more accurately. And just like that, every present and future hunter in the tribe hunts with a more effective spear.</p>
<p>Language allows the best epiphanies of the very smartest people, through the generations, to accumulate into a little collective tower of tribal knowledge—a &#8220;greatest hits&#8221; of their ancestors&#8217; best &#8220;aha!&#8221; moments. Every new generation has this knowledge tower installed in their heads as their starting point in life, leading them to new, even better discoveries that build on what their ancestors learned, as the tribe&#8217;s knowledge continues to grow bigger and wiser. Language is the difference between this:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6474" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b.png" alt="minimal tribal knowledge growth before language" width="800" height="355" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b.png 1220w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b-300x133.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b-768x341.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b-600x266.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6458" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="894" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1.png 1318w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1-268x300.png 268w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1-768x858.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1-537x600.png 537w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>The major trajectory upgrade happens for two reasons. Each generation can learn a lot more new things when they can talk to each other, compare notes, and combine their individual learnings (that’s why the blue bars are so much higher in the second graph). And each generation can successfully pass a higher percentage of their learnings on to the next generation, so knowledge <em>sticks</em> better through time.</p>
<p>Knowledge, when shared, becomes like a grand, collective, inter-generational collaboration. Hundreds of generations later, what started as a pro tip about a certain berry to avoid has become an intricate system of planting long rows of the stomach-friendly berry bushes and harvesting them annually. The initial stroke of genius about wildebeest migrations has turned into a system of goat domestication. The spear innovation, through hundreds of incremental tweaks over tens of thousands of years, has become the bow and arrow.</p>
<p>Language gives a group of humans a <em>collective intelligence </em>far greater than individual human intelligence and allows each human to benefit from the collective intelligence as if he came up with it all himself. We think of the bow and arrow as a primitive technology, but raise Einstein in the woods with no existing knowledge and tell him to come up with the best hunting device he can, and he won&#8217;t be <em>nearly </em>intelligent or skilled or knowledgeable enough to invent the bow and arrow. Only a <em>collective </em>human effort can pull that off.</p>
<p>Being able to speak to each other also allowed humans to form complex social structures which, along with advanced technologies like farming and animal domestication, led tribes over time to begin to settle into permanent locations and merge into organized super-tribes. When this happened, each tribe’s tower of accumulated knowledge could be shared with the larger super-tribe, forming a super-tower. Mass cooperation raised the quality of life for everyone, and by 10,000 BC, the first cities had formed.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, there&#8217;s something called Metcalfe&#8217;s law, which states that &#8220;the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.&#8221; And they include this little chart of old telephones:<a href="#footnote2-1-6120" id="note2-1-6120" rel="footnote2">1</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6121" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_.png" alt="" width="200" height="460" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_.png 476w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_-131x300.png 131w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_-261x600.png 261w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p>But the same idea applies to people. Two people can have one conversation. Three people have four unique conversation groups (three different two-person conversations and a fourth conversation between all three as a group). Five people have 26. Twenty people have 1,048,555.</p>
<p>So not only did the members of a city benefit from a <em>huge </em>knowledge tower as a foundation, but Metcalfe&#8217;s law means that the number of conversation possibilities now skyrocketed to an unprecedented amount of variety. More conversations meant more ideas bumping up against each other, which led to many more discoveries clicking together, and the pace of innovation soared.</p>
<p>Humans soon mastered agriculture, which freed many people up to think about all kinds of other ideas, and it wasn&#8217;t long before they stumbled upon a new, giant breakthrough: writing.</p>
<p>Historians think humans first started writing things down about 5 &#8211; 6,000 years ago. Up until that point, the collective knowledge tower was stored only in a network of people&#8217;s memories and accessed only through livestream word-of-mouth communication. This system worked in small tribes, but with a vastly larger body of knowledge shared among a vastly larger group of people, memories alone would have had a hard time supporting it all, and most of it would have ended up lost.</p>
<p>If language let humans send a thought from one brain to another, writing let them stick a thought onto a physical <em>object</em>,<em> </em>like a stone, where it could live forever. When people began writing on thin sheets of parchment or paper, huge fields of knowledge that would take weeks to be conveyed by word of mouth could be compressed into a book or a scroll you could hold in your hand. The human collective knowledge tower now lived in physical form, neatly organized on the shelves of city libraries and universities.</p>
<p>These shelves became humanity&#8217;s grand instruction manual on everything. They guided humanity toward new inventions and discoveries, and those would in turn become new books on the shelves, as the grand instruction manual built upon itself. The manual taught us the intricacies of trade and currency, of shipbuilding and architecture, of medicine and astronomy. Each generation began life with a higher floor of knowledge and technology than the last, and progress continued to accelerate.</p>
<p>But painstakingly handwritten books were treated like treasures,<a href="#footnote-2-6120" id="note-2-6120" rel="footnote">2</a> and likely only accessible to the extreme elite (in the mid 15th century, there were only <a href="http://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-gutenberg-bible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30,000 books</a> in all of Europe). And then came another breakthrough: the printing press.</p>
<p>In the 15th century, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg#/media/File:Gutenberg.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beardy</a> Johannes Gutenberg came up with a way to create multiple identical copies of the same book, much more quickly and cheaply than ever before. (Or, more accurately, when Gutenberg was born, humanity had already figured out the first 95% of how to invent the printing press, and Gutenberg, with that knowledge as his starting point, invented the last 5%.) (Oh, also, Gutenberg didn&#8217;t invent the printing press, <a href="http://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-gutenberg-bible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Chinese did</a> a bunch of centuries earlier. Pretty reliable rule is that everything you think was invented somewhere other than China was probably actually invented in China.) Here&#8217;s how it worked:</p>
<div class="wbwAside">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>It Turns Out Gutenberg Isn&#8217;t Actually Impressive Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>To prepare to write this blue box, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ojyCDRc8uc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> explaining how Gutenberg&#8217;s press worked and was surprised to find myself unimpressed. I always assumed Gutenberg had made some genius machine, but it turns out he just created a bunch of stamps of letters and punctuation and manually arranged them as the page of a book and then put ink on them and pressed a piece of paper onto the letters, and that was one book page. While he had the letters all set up for that page, he&#8217;d make a bunch of copies. Then he&#8217;d spend forever manually rearranging the stamps (this is the &#8220;movable type&#8221; part) into the next page, and then do a bunch of copies of that. His first project was 180 copies of the Bible,<a href="#footnote-3-6120" id="note-3-6120" rel="footnote">3</a> which took him and his employees two years.</p>
<p><em>That</em>&#8216;<em>s </em>Gutenberg&#8217;s thing? A bunch of stamps? I feel like I could have come up with that pretty easily. Not really clear why it took humanity 5,000 years to go from figuring out how to write to creating a bunch of manual stamps. I guess it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m unimpressed with Gutenberg—I&#8217;m neutral on Gutenberg, he&#8217;s fine—it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m unimpressed with everyone else.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite how disappointing Gutenberg&#8217;s press turned out to be, it was a <em>huge </em>leap forward for humanity&#8217;s ability to spread information. Over the coming centuries, printing technology rapidly improved, bringing the number of pages a machine could print in an hour from about 25 in Gutenberg&#8217;s time<a href="#footnote-4-6120" id="note-4-6120" rel="footnote">4</a> up 100-fold to 2,400 by the early 19th century.<a href="#footnote2-2-6120" id="note2-2-6120" rel="footnote2">2</a>
<p>Mass-produced books allowed information to spread like wildfire, and with books being made increasingly affordable, no longer was education an elite privilege—millions now had access to books, and literacy rates shot upwards. One person&#8217;s thoughts could now reach millions of people. The era of mass communication had begun.</p>
<p>The avalanche of books allowed knowledge to transcend borders, as the world&#8217;s regional knowledge towers finally merged into one species-wide knowledge tower that stretched into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The better we could communicate on a mass scale, the more our species began to function like a single organism, with humanity&#8217;s collective knowledge tower as its brain and each individual human brain like a nerve or a muscle fiber in its body. With the era of mass communication upon us, the collective human organism—the Human Colossus—rose into existence.</p>

<p>With the entire body of collective human knowledge in its brain, the Human Colossus began inventing things no human could have dreamed of inventing on their own—things that would have seemed like absurd science fiction to people only a few generations before.</p>
<p>It turned our ox-drawn carts into speedy locomotives and our horse-and-buggies into shiny metal cars. It turned our lanterns into lightbulbs and written letters into telephone calls and factory workers into industrial machines. It sent us soaring through the skies and out into space. It redefined the meaning of &#8220;mass communication&#8221; by giving us radio and TV, opening up a world where a thought in someone&#8217;s head could be beamed instantly into the brains of a billion people.</p>
<p>If an individual human&#8217;s core motivation is to pass its genes on, which keeps the species going, the forces of macroeconomics make the Human Colossus&#8217;s core motivation to create value, which means it tends to want to invent newer and better technology. Every time it does that, it becomes an even better inventor, which means it can invent new stuff even faster.</p>
<p>And around the middle of the 20th century, the Human Colossus began working on its most ambitious invention yet.</p>
<p>The Colossus had figured out a long time ago that the best way to create value was to invent value-creating <em>machines</em>. Machines were better than humans at doing many kinds of work, which generated a flood of new resources that could be put towards value creation. Perhaps even more importantly, machine labor freed up huge portions of human time and energy—i.e. huge portions of the Colossus itself—to focus on innovation. It had already outsourced the work of our arms to factory machines and the work of our legs to driving machines, and it had done so through the power of its brain—now what if, somehow, it could outsource the work of the brain <em>itself </em>to a machine?</p>
<p>The first digital computers sprung up in the 1940s.</p>
<p>One kind of brain labor computers could do was the work of information storage—they were <em>remembering</em> machines. But we already knew how to outsource our memories using books, just like we had been outsourcing our leg labor to <a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">horses</a> long before cars provided a far better solution. Computers were simply a memory-outsourcing upgrade.</p>
<p>Information-<em>processing </em>was a different story—a type of brain labor we had never figured out how to outsource. The Human Colossus had always had to do all of its own computing. Computers changed that.</p>
<p>Factory machines allowed us to outsource a physical process—we put a material in, the machines physically processed it and spit out the results. Computers could do the same thing for information processing. A software program was like a factory machine for information processes.</p>
<p>These new information-storage/organizing/processing machines proved to be useful. Computers began to play a central role in the day-to-day operation of companies and governments. By the late 1980s, it was common for individual people to own their own personal brain assistant.</p>
<p>Then came another leap.</p>
<p>In the early 90s, we taught millions of isolated machine-brains how to communicate with one another. They formed a worldwide computer network, and a new giant was born—the Computer Colossus.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6444" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1.png" alt="" width="500" height="684" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1.png 1096w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1-219x300.png 219w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1-768x1051.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1-438x600.png 438w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The Computer Colossus and the great network it formed were like popeye spinach for the Human Colossus.</p>
<p>If individual human brains are the nerves and muscle fibers of the Human Colossus, the internet gave the giant its first legit nervous system. Each of its nodes was now interconnected to all of its other nodes, and information could travel through the system with light speed. This made the Human Colossus a faster, more fluid thinker.</p>
<p>The internet gave billions of humans instant, free, easily-searchable access to the entire human knowledge tower (which by now stretched past the moon). This made the Human Colossus a smarter, faster learner.</p>
<p>And if individual computers had served as brain extensions for individual people, companies, or governments, the Computer Colossus was a brain extension for the entire Human Colossus itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HC-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6443" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HC-3.png" alt="" width="500" height="870" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HC-3.png 1096w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HC-3-172x300.png 172w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HC-3-768x1337.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HC-3-345x600.png 345w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>With its first real nervous system, an upgraded brain, and a powerful new tool, the Human Colossus took inventing to a whole new level—and noticing how useful its new computer friend was, it focused a large portion of its efforts on advancing computer technology.</p>
<p>It figured out how to make computers faster and cheaper. It made internet faster and wireless. It made computing chips smaller and smaller until there was a powerful computer in everyone&#8217;s pocket.</p>
<p>Each innovation was like a new truckload of spinach for the Human Colossus.</p>
<p>But today, the Human Colossus has its eyes set on an even bigger idea than more spinach. Computers have been a game-changer, allowing humanity to outsource many of its brain-related tasks and better function as a single organism. But there’s one kind of brain labor computers still can’t quite do. <em>Thinking.</em></p>
<p>Computers can compute and organize and run complex software—software that can even learn on its own. But they can’t <em>think </em>in the way humans can. The Human Colossus knows that everything it&#8217;s built has originated with its ability to reason creatively and independently—and it knows that the <em>ultimate </em>brain extension tool would be one that can really, actually, legitimately <em>think</em>. It has no idea what it will be like when the Computer Colossus can think for itself—when it one day opens its eyes and becomes a <em>real </em>colossus—but with its core goal to create value and push technology to its limits, the Human Colossus is determined to find out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>We’ll come back here in a bit. First, we have some learning to do.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve discussed <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before</a>, knowledge works like a tree. If you try to learn a branch or a leaf of a topic before you have a solid tree trunk foundation of understanding in your head, it won&#8217;t work. The branches and leaves will have nothing to stick to, so they&#8217;ll fall right out of your head.</p>
<p>We’ve established that Elon Musk wants to build a wizard hat for the brain, and understanding why he wants to do that is the key to understanding Neuralink—and to understanding what our future might actually be like.</p>
<p>But none of that will make much sense until we really get into the truly mind-blowing concept of what a wizard hat is, what it might be like to wear one, and how we get there from where we are today.</p>
<p>The foundation for <em>that </em>discussion is an understanding of what brain-machine interfaces are, how they work, and where the technology is today.</p>
<p>Finally, BMIs themselves are just a larger branch—not the tree&#8217;s trunk. In order to really understand BMIs and how they work, we need to understand the brain. Getting how the brain works is our tree trunk.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6479" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-1.png 1100w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-1-150x150.png 150w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-1-300x300.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-1-768x768.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-1-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><a name="part2"></a>So we’ll start with the brain, which will prepare us to learn about BMIs, which will teach us about what it’ll take to build a wizard hat, and that’ll set things up for an insane discussion about the future—which will get our heads right where they need to be to wrap themselves around why Elon thinks a wizard hat is such a critical piece of our future. And by the time we reach the end, this whole thing should click into place.</p>

<p>This post was a nice reminder of why I like working with a brain that looks nice and cute like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cartoon-brain.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6253" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cartoon-brain.png" alt="" width="400" height="243" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cartoon-brain.png 1100w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cartoon-brain-300x182.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cartoon-brain-768x466.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cartoon-brain-600x364.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>Because the real brain is extremely uncute and upsetting-looking. People are gross.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been living in a shimmery, oozy, blood-vessel-lined Google Images hell for the past month, and now you have to deal with it too. So just settle in.</p>
<p>We’ll start outside the head. One thing I will give to biology is that it&#8217;s sometimes very satisfying,<a href="#footnote-5-6120" id="note-5-6120" rel="footnote">5</a> and the brain has some satisfying things going on. The first of which is that there&#8217;s a real Russian doll situation going on with your head.</p>
<p>You have your hair, and under that is your scalp, and then you think your skull comes next—but it&#8217;s actually like 19 things and then your skull:<a href="#footnote2-3-6120" id="note2-3-6120" rel="footnote2">3</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A270654_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6123 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A270654_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="285" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A270654_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.jpg 593w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A270654_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></a></p>
<p>Then below your skull,<a href="#footnote-6-6120" id="note-6-6120" rel="footnote">6</a> another whole bunch of things are going on before you get to the brain<a href="#footnote2-4-6120" id="note2-4-6120" rel="footnote2">4</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Men1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6124 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Men1.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="437" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Men1.jpg 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Men1-300x245.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></a></p>
<p>Your brain has three membranes around it underneath the skull:</p>
<p>On the outside, there&#8217;s the <strong>dura mater</strong> (which means &#8220;hard mother&#8221; in Latin), a firm, rugged, waterproof layer. The dura is flush with the skull. I&#8217;ve heard it said that the brain has no pain sensory area, but the dura actually does—it&#8217;s about as sensitive as the skin on your face—and pressure on or contusions in the dura often account for people&#8217;s bad headaches.</p>
<p>Then below that there&#8217;s the <strong>arachnoid mater </strong>(&#8220;spider mother&#8221;), which is a layer of skin and then an open space with these stretchy-looking fibers. I always thought my brain was just floating aimlessly in my head in some kind of fluid, but actually, the only real space gap between the outside of the brain and the inner wall of the skull is this arachnoid business. Those fibers stabilize the brain in position so it can&#8217;t move too much, and they act as a shock absorber when your head bumps into something. This area is filled with spinal fluid, which keeps the brain mostly buoyant, since its density is similar to that of water.</p>
<p>Finally you have the <strong>pia mater </strong>(&#8220;soft mother&#8221;), a fine, delicate layer of skin that&#8217;s fused with the outside of the brain. You know how when you see a brain, it&#8217;s always covered with icky blood vessels? Those aren&#8217;t actually on the brain&#8217;s surface, they&#8217;re embedded in the pia. (For the non-squeamish, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak1FWodg5Nw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&#8217;s a video</a> of a professor peeling the pia off of a human brain.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full overview, using the head of what looks like probably a pig:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6125 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="530" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b.jpg 530w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b-150x150.jpg 150w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" /></a></p>
<p>From the left you have the skin (the pink), then two scalp layers, then the skull, then the dura, arachnoid, and on the far right, just the brain covered by the pia.</p>
<p>Once we&#8217;ve stripped everything down, we&#8217;re left with this silly boy:<a href="#footnote2-5-6120" id="note2-5-6120" rel="footnote2">5</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6126 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="494" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1.jpg 660w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1-300x240.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1-600x480.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p>This ridiculous-looking thing is the most complex known object in the universe—three pounds of what neuroengineer Tim Hanson calls &#8220;<span class="s1">one of the most information-dense, structured, and self-structuring matter known.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-6-6120" id="note2-6-6120" rel="footnote2">6</a> All while operating on only <a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-11/neuron-computer-chips-could-overcome-power-limitations-digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 watts</a> of power (an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-supercomputer-idUSKCN0J11VV20141117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">equivalently powerful computer</a> runs on 24,000,000 watts).</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also what MIT professor Polina Anikeeva <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qi5uoNYXqg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calls</a> &#8220;soft pudding you could scoop with a spoon.&#8221; Brain surgeon Ben Rapoport described it to me more scientifically, as &#8220;somewhere between pudding and jello.&#8221; He explained that if you placed a brain on a table, gravity would make it lose its shape and flatten out a bit, kind of like a jellyfish. We often don&#8217;t think of the brain as so smooshy, because it&#8217;s normally suspended in water.</p>
<p>But this is what we all are. You look in the mirror and see your body and your face and you think that&#8217;s you—but that&#8217;s really just the machine you&#8217;re riding in. What you actually are is a zany-looking ball of jello. I hope that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>And given how weird that is, you can&#8217;t really blame Aristotle, or the ancient Egyptians, or many others, for assuming that the brain was somewhat-meaningless &#8220;cranial stuffing&#8221; (Aristotle believed the heart was the center of intelligence).<a href="#footnote2-7-6120" id="note2-7-6120" rel="footnote2">7</a>
<p>Eventually, humans figured out the deal. But only kind of.</p>
<p>Professor Krishna Shenoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuATvhlcUU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likens</a> our understanding of the brain to humanity&#8217;s grasp on the world map <a href="https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0309/images/maps_4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the early 1500s</a>.</p>
<p>Another professor, <a href="http://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/people/jeff-lichtman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Lichtman</a>, is even harsher. He starts off his courses by asking his students the question, &#8220;If everything you need to know about the brain is a mile, how far have we walked in this mile?&#8221; He says students give answers like three-quarters of a mile, half a mile, a quarter of a mile, etc.—but that he believes the real answer is &#8220;about three inches.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-8-6120" id="note2-8-6120" rel="footnote2">8</a>

<p>A third professor, neuroscientist <a href="https://www.morancerf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moran Cerf</a>, shared with me an old neuroscience saying that points out why trying to master the brain is a bit of a catch-22: &#8220;If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe with the help of the great knowledge tower our species is building, we can get there at some point. For now, let&#8217;s go through what we do currently know about the jellyfish in our heads—starting with the big picture.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>The brain, zoomed out</strong></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the major sections of the brain using a hemisphere cross section. So this is what the brain looks like in your head:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sh202-hs.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6193 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sh202-hs.png" alt="" width="336" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take the brain out of the head and remove the left hemisphere, which gives us a good view of the inside.<a href="#footnote2-9-6120" id="note2-9-6120" rel="footnote2">9</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6299 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section.png" alt="" width="600" height="454" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Neurologist <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul MacLean</a> made a simple diagram that illustrates the basic idea we talked about earlier of the reptile brain coming first in evolution, then being built upon by mammals, and finally being built upon again to give us our brain trifecta.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how this essentially maps out on our real brain:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section-LABELED.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6300 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section-LABELED.png" alt="" width="600" height="454" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section-LABELED.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cross-section-LABELED-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at each section:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Reptilian Brain: The Brain Stem (and Cerebellum)</strong></span></p>
<p>This is the most ancient part of our brain:<a href="#footnote2-10-6120" id="note2-10-6120" rel="footnote2">10</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/brainstem-v2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6489" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/brainstem-v2.png" alt="midbrain, pons, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata" width="400" height="314" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/brainstem-v2.png 1208w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/brainstem-v2-300x235.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/brainstem-v2-768x603.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/brainstem-v2-600x471.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the section of our brain cross section above that the frog boss resides over. In fact, a frog&#8217;s entire brain is similar to this lower part of our brain. Here’s a real frog brain:<a href="#footnote2-11-6120" id="note2-11-6120" rel="footnote2">11</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frogside107.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6129 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frogside107.jpg" alt="" width="505" height="185" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frogside107.jpg 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frogside107-300x110.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></a></p>
<p>When you understand the function of these parts, the fact that they&#8217;re ancient makes sense—everything these parts do, frogs and lizards can do. These are the major sections (click any of these spinning images to see a high-res version):</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The</strong> <strong>medulla oblongata</strong></span> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Medulla_oblongata-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6261 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Medulla_oblongata_small.gif" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>The medulla oblongata really just wants you to not die. It does the thankless tasks of controlling involuntary things like your heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure, along with making you vomit when it thinks you&#8217;ve been poisoned.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The pons</strong></span> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pons-1.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6260 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pons_small.gif" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>The pons&#8217;s thing is that it does a little bit of this and a little bit of that. It deals with swallowing, bladder control, facial expressions, chewing, saliva, tears, and posture—really just whatever it&#8217;s in the mood for.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The midbrain</strong></span> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Midbrain.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6259 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Midbrain_small.gif" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>The midbrain is dealing with an even bigger identity crisis than the pons. You know a brain part is going through some shit when almost all its functions are already another brain part’s thing. In the case of the midbrain, it deals with vision, hearing, motor control, alertness, temperature control, and a bunch of other things that other people in the brain already do. The rest of the brain doesn&#8217;t seem very into the midbrain either, given that they created a ridiculously uneven &#8220;forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain&#8221; divide that intentionally isolates the midbrain all by itself while everyone else hangs out.<a href="#footnote2-12-6120" id="note2-12-6120" rel="footnote2">12</a>

<p>One thing I&#8217;ll grant the pons and midbrain is that it&#8217;s the two of them that control your voluntary eye movement, which is a pretty legit job. So if right now you move your eyes around, that&#8217;s you doing something specifically with your pons and midbrain.<a href="#footnote-7-6120" id="note-7-6120" rel="footnote">7</a>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The cerebellum</strong></span> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cerebellum.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6258 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cerebellum_animation_small.gif" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>The odd-looking thing that looks like your brain’s scrotum is your cerebellum (Latin for &#8220;little brain&#8221;), which makes sure you stay a balanced, coordinated, and normal-moving person. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrt0Gq0zS4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here&#8217;s that rad professor again</a> showing you what a real cerebellum looks like.<a href="#footnote-8-6120" id="note-8-6120" rel="footnote">8</a>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Paleo-Mammalian Brain: The Limbic System</strong></span></p>
<p>Above the brain stem is the limbic system—the part of the brain that makes humans so insane.<a href="#footnote2-13-6120" id="note2-13-6120" rel="footnote2">13</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/limbic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6429" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/limbic.jpg" alt="limbic system diagram" width="500" height="451" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/limbic.jpg 689w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/limbic-300x270.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/limbic-600x541.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The limbic system is a survival system. A decent rule of thumb is that whenever you&#8217;re doing something that your dog might also do—eating, drinking, having sex, fighting, hiding or running away from something scary—your limbic system is probably behind the wheel. Whether it feels like it or not, when you&#8217;re doing any of those things, you&#8217;re in primitive survival mode.</p>
<p>The limbic system is also where your emotions live, and in the end, emotions are also all about survival—they&#8217;re the more advanced mechanisms of survival, necessary for animals living in a complex social structure.</p>
<p>In other posts, when I refer to your <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instant Gratification Monkey</a>, your <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Survival Mammoth</a>, and <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all your other animals</a>—I&#8217;m usually referring to your limbic system. Anytime there&#8217;s an internal battle going on in your head, it&#8217;s likely that the limbic system&#8217;s role is urging you to do the thing you&#8217;ll later regret doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that gaining control over your limbic system is both the definition of maturity and the core human struggle. It&#8217;s not that we would be better off without our limbic systems—limbic systems are half of what makes us distinctly human, and most of the fun of life is related to emotions and/or fulfilling your animal needs—it&#8217;s just that your limbic system doesn&#8217;t get that you live in a civilization, and if you let it run your life too much, it&#8217;ll quickly ruin your life.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s take a closer look at it. There are a lot of little parts of the limbic system, but we&#8217;ll keep it to the biggest celebrities:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The amygdala</strong> </span> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Amygdala.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6392 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Amygdala10.png" alt="" width="250" height="234" /></a></p>
<p>The amygdala is kind of an emotional wreck of a brain structure. It deals with anxiety, sadness, and our responses to fear. There are two amygdalae, and oddly, the left one has been shown to be more balanced, sometimes producing happy feelings in addition to the usual angsty ones, while the right one is always in a bad mood.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The hippocampus</strong> </span> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hippocampus.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6391 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/large.gif" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Your hippocampus (Greek for &#8220;seahorse&#8221; because it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#/media/File:Hippocampus_and_seahorse_cropped.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looks like one</a>) is like a scratch board for memory. When rats start to memorize directions in a maze, the memory gets encoded in their hippocampus—quite literally. Different parts of the rat&#8217;s two hippocampi will fire during different parts of the maze, since each section of the maze is stored in its own section of the hippocampus. But if after learning one maze, the rat is given other tasks and is brought back to the original maze a year later, it will have a hard time remembering it, because the hippocampus scratch board has been mostly wiped of the memory so as to free itself up for new memories.</p>
<p>The condition in the movie <em>Memento</em> is a real thing—anterograde amnesia—and it’s caused by damage to the hippocampus. Alzheimer&#8217;s also starts in the hippocampus before working its way through many parts of the brain, which is why, of the slew of devastating effects of the disease, diminished memory happens first.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The t</strong><strong>halamus</strong></span> <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thalamus.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6388 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/article_codev-2015-10-30-608d7118d8-Thalamus_small.gif" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>In its central position in the brain, the thalamus also serves as a sensory middleman that receives information from your sensory organs and sends them to your cortex for processing. When you&#8217;re sleeping, the thalamus goes to sleep with you, which means the sensory middleman is off duty. That&#8217;s why in a deep sleep, some sound or light or touch often will not wake you up. If you want to wake someone up who&#8217;s in a deep sleep, you have to be aggressive enough to wake their thalamus up.</p>
<p>The exception is your sense of smell, which is the one sense that bypasses the thalamus. That&#8217;s why smelling salts are used to wake up a passed-out person. While we&#8217;re here, cool fact: smell is the function of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_bulb#/media/File:Head_olfactory_nerve_-_olfactory_bulb_en.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olfactory bulb</a> </strong>and is the most ancient of the senses. Unlike the other senses, smell is located deep in the limbic system, where it works closely with the hippocampus and amygdala—which is why smell is so closely tied to memory and emotion.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The Neo-Mammalian Brain: The Cortex</strong></span></p>
<p>Finally, we arrive at the cortex. The cerebral cortex. The neocortex. The cerebrum. The pallium.</p>
<p>The most important part of the whole brain can&#8217;t figure out what its name is. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening:</p>
<div class="wbwAside">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The What the Hell is it Actually Called Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>The<strong> cerebrum </strong>is the whole big top/outside part of the brain but it also technically includes some of the internal parts too.</p>
<p><strong>Cortex </strong>means &#8220;bark&#8221; in Latin and is the word used for the outer layer of many organs, not just the brain. The outside of the cerebellum is the cerebellar cortex. And the outside of the cerebrum is the <strong>cerebral cortex.</strong> Only mammals have cerebral cortices. The equivalent part of the brain in reptiles is called the <strong>pallium. </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>neocortex </strong>is often used interchangeably with &#8220;cerebral cortex,&#8221; but it&#8217;s technically the outer layers of the cerebral cortex that are especially developed in more advanced mammals. The other parts are called the allocortex.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we&#8217;ll be mostly referring to the neocortex <strong>but we&#8217;ll just call it the cortex, </strong>since that&#8217;s the least annoying way to do it for everyone.</p>
</div>
<p>The cortex is in charge of basically everything—processing what you see, hear, and feel, along with language, movement, thinking, planning, and personality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s divided into four lobes:<a href="#footnote2-14-6120" id="note2-14-6120" rel="footnote2">14</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6256" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="352" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2.jpg 800w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2-300x211.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2-768x540.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2-600x422.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty unsatisfying to describe what they each do, because they each do so many things and there&#8217;s a lot of overlap, but to oversimplify:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frontal_lobe.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>frontal lobe </strong></a>(click the words to see a gif)<strong> </strong>handles your personality, along with a lot of what we think of as &#8220;thinking&#8221;—reasoning, planning, and executive function. In particular, a lot of your thinking takes place in the front part of the frontal lobe, called the <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong>—the adult in your head. The prefrontal cortex is the other character in those internal battles that go on in your life. The rational decision-maker trying to get you to do your work. The authentic voice trying to get you to stop worrying so much what others think and just be yourself. The higher being who wishes you&#8217;d stop sweating the small stuff.</p>
<p>As if that&#8217;s not enough to worry about, the frontal lobe is also in charge of your body&#8217;s movement. The top strip of the frontal lobe is your <strong>primary motor cortex.</strong><a href="#footnote2-15-6120" id="note2-15-6120" rel="footnote2">15</a>

<p>Then there’s the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Parietal_lobe_animation.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>parietal lobe</strong></a> which, among other things, controls your sense of touch, particularly in the <strong>primary somatosensory cortex</strong>, the strip right next to the primary motor cortex.<a href="#footnote2-16-6120" id="note2-16-6120" rel="footnote2">16</a>

<p>The motor and somatosensory cortices are fun because they&#8217;re well-mapped. Neuroscientists know exactly which part of each strip connects to each part of your body. Which leads us to the creepiest diagram of this post: the <em>homunculus</em>.</p>

<p>The homunculus, created by pioneer neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, visually displays how the motor and somatosensory cortices are mapped. The larger the body part in the diagram, the more of the cortex is dedicated to its movement or sense of touch. A couple interesting things about this:</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s amazing that more of your brain is dedicated to the movement and feeling of your face and hands than to the rest of your body combined. This makes sense though—you need to make incredibly nuanced facial expressions and your hands need to be unbelievably dexterous, while the rest of your body—your shoulder, your knee, your back—can move and feel things much more crudely. This is why people can play the piano with their fingers but not with their toes.</p>
<p>Second, it&#8217;s interesting how the two cortices are basically dedicated to the same body parts, in the same proportions. I never really thought about the fact that the same parts of your body you need to have a lot of movement control over tend to also be the most sensitive to touch.</p>
<p>Finally, I came across this shit and I’ve been living with it ever since—so now you have to too. A 3-dimensional homunculus man.<a href="#footnote2-17-6120" id="note2-17-6120" rel="footnote2">17</a>

<p>Moving on—</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Temporal_lobe_animation2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">temporal lobe</a> </strong>is where a lot of your memory lives, and being right next to your ears, it&#8217;s also the home of your <strong>auditory cortex</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>Last, at the back of your head is the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Occipital_lobe.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>occipital lobe</strong></a><strong>, </strong>which houses your <strong>visual cortex</strong> and is almost entirely dedicated to vision.</p>
<p>Now for a long time, I thought these major lobes were <em>chunks</em> of the brain—like, segments of the whole 3D structure. But actually, the cortex is just the outer <em>two</em><em> millimeters </em>of the brain—the thickness of a nickel—and the meat of the space underneath is mostly just wiring.</p>
<div class="wbwAside">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Why Brains Are So Wrinkly Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve discussed, the evolution of our brain happened by building outwards, adding newer, fancier features on top of the existing model. But building outwards has its limits, because the need for humans to emerge into the world through someone&#8217;s vagina puts a cap on how big our heads could be.<a href="#footnote-9-6120" id="note-9-6120" rel="footnote">9</a>
<p>So evolution got innovative. Because the cortex is so thin, it scales by increasing its surface area. That means that by creating lots of folds (including both sides <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Frontal_lobe_animation.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">folding down into the gap</a> between the two hemispheres), you can more than triple the area of the brain&#8217;s surface without increasing the volume too much. When the brain first develops in the womb, the cortex is smooth—the folds form mostly in the last two months of pregnancy:<a href="#footnote2-18-6120" id="note2-18-6120" rel="footnote2">18</a>

<p>If you could take the cortex off the brain, you&#8217;d end up with a 2mm-thick sheet with an area of 2,000-2,400cm<sup>2</sup>—about the size of a 48cm x 48cm (19in x 19in) square.<a href="#footnote-10-6120" id="note-10-6120" rel="footnote">10</a> A dinner napkin. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Guy-holding-napkin.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6404" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Guy-holding-napkin.png" alt="" width="300" height="454" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Guy-holding-napkin.png 406w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Guy-holding-napkin-198x300.png 198w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Guy-holding-napkin-396x600.png 396w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This napkin is where most of the action in your brain happens—it&#8217;s why you can think, move, feel, see, hear, remember, and speak and understand language. Best napkin ever.</p>
<p>And remember before when I said that you were a jello ball? Well the <em>you </em>you think of when you think of yourself—it&#8217;s really mainly your cortex. Which means you&#8217;re actually a napkin.</p>
<p>The magic of the folds in increasing the napkin&#8217;s size is clear when we put another brain on top of our stripped-off cortex:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6302" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png" alt="" width="543" height="461" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png 796w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-300x254.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-768x651.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-600x509.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></a></p>
<p>So while it&#8217;s not perfect, modern science has a decent understanding of the big picture when it comes to the brain. We also have a decent understanding of the little picture. Let&#8217;s check it out:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>The brain, zoomed in</strong></span></p>
<p>Even though we figured out that the brain was the seat of our intelligence a long time ago, it wasn&#8217;t until pretty recently that science understood what the brain was made of. Scientists knew that the body was made of cells, but in the late 19th century, Italian physician Camillo Golgi figured out how to use a <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnana.2016.00038/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staining method</a> to see what brain cells actually looked like. The result was surprising:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/220px-GolgiStainedPyramidalCell.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6138 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/220px-GolgiStainedPyramidalCell.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t what a cell was supposed to look like. Without quite realizing it yet,<a href="#footnote-11-6120" id="note-11-6120" rel="footnote">11</a> Golgi had discovered the neuron.</p>
<p>Scientists realized that the neuron was the core unit in the vast communication network that makes up the brains and nervous systems of nearly all animals.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t until the 1950s that scientists worked out <em>how </em>neurons communicate with each other.</p>
<p>An axon, the long strand of a neuron that carries information, is normally microscopic in diameter—too small for scientists to test on until recently. But in the 1930s, English zoologist J. Z. Young discovered that the squid, randomly, could change everything for our understanding, because squids have an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omXS1bjYLMI" target="_blank" rel="” noopener noreferrer">unusually huge axon</a> in their bodies that could be experimented on. A couple decades later, using the squid’s giant axon, scientists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley definitively figured out how neurons send information: the action potential. Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of different kinds of neurons—<a href="#footnote2-19-6120" id="note2-19-6120" rel="footnote2">19</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neuron_types.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6139 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neuron_types.gif" alt="" width="608" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>—but for simplicity, we&#8217;ll discuss the cliché textbook neuron—a pyramidal cell, like one you might find in your motor cortex. To make a neuron diagram, we can start with a guy:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6337 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-1.png" alt="" width="91" height="202" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-1.png 136w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-1-135x300.png 135w" sizes="(max-width: 91px) 100vw, 91px" /></a></p>
<p>And then if we just give him a few extra legs, some hair, take his arms off, and stretch him out—we have a neuron.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6338" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="567" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-2.png 817w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-2-300x283.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-2-768x726.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-2-600x567.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>And let&#8217;s add in a few more neurons.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6339 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-3.png" alt="" width="800" height="676" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-3.png 1421w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-3-300x253.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-3-768x649.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-3-600x507.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>Rather than launch into the full, detailed explanation for how action potentials work—which involves a lot of unnecessary and uninteresting technical information you already dealt with in 9th-grade biology—I&#8217;ll link to this great Khan Academy <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/a/the-synapse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explainer article</a> for those who want the full story. We&#8217;ll go through the very basic ideas that are relevant for our purposes.</p>
<p>So our guy&#8217;s body stem—the neuron&#8217;s <strong>axon</strong>—has a negative &#8220;resting potential,&#8221; which means that when it&#8217;s at rest, its electrical charge is slightly negative. At all times, a bunch of people&#8217;s feet keep touching<a href="#footnote-12-6120" id="note-12-6120" rel="footnote">12</a> our guy&#8217;s hair—the neuron&#8217;s <strong>dendrites</strong>—whether he likes it or not. Their feet drop chemicals called <strong>neurotransmitters</strong><a href="#footnote-13-6120" id="note-13-6120" rel="footnote">13</a> onto his hair—which pass through his head (the cell body, or<strong> soma</strong>) and, depending on the chemical, raise or lower the charge in his body a little bit. It&#8217;s a little unpleasant for our neuron guy, but not a huge deal—and nothing else happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6340 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4.png" alt="" width="800" height="672" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4.png 1430w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4-300x252.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4-768x644.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4-600x503.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>But if enough chemicals touch his hair to raise his charge over a certain point—the neuron&#8217;s &#8220;threshold potential&#8221;—then it triggers an <strong>action potential</strong>, and our guy is electrocuted.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6341 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5.png" alt="" width="800" height="672" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5.png 1429w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5-300x252.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5-768x645.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5-600x504.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a binary situation—either <em>nothing </em>happens to our guy, or he&#8217;s fully electrocuted. He can&#8217;t be kind of electrocuted, or extra electrocuted—he&#8217;s either not electrocuted at all, or he&#8217;s fully electrocuted to the exact same degree every time.</p>
<p>When this happens, a pulse of electricity (in the form of a brief reversal of his body&#8217;s normal charge from negative to positive and then rapidly back down to his normal negative) zips down his body (the axon) and into his feet—the neuron&#8217;s <strong>axon terminals</strong>—which themselves touch a bunch of other people&#8217;s hair (the points of contact are called <strong>synapses</strong>). When the action potential reaches his feet, it causes them to release chemicals onto the people&#8217;s hair they&#8217;re touching, which may or may not cause those people to be electrocuted, just like he was.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6342" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6.png" alt="" width="759" height="641" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6.png 1421w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6-300x253.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6-768x649.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6-600x507.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></a></p>
<p>This is usually how info moves through the nervous system—chemical information sent in the tiny gap between neurons triggers electrical information to pass <em>through </em>the neuron—but sometimes, in situations when the body needs to move a signal extra quickly, neuron-to-neuron connections can themselves be electric.</p>
<p>Action potentials move at between 1 and 100 meters/second. Part of the reason for this large range is that another type of cell in the nervous system—a Schwann cell—acts like a super nurturing grandmother and constantly wraps some types of axons in layers of fat blankets called <strong>myelin sheath.</strong> Like this (takes a second to start):<a href="#footnote2-20-6120" id="note2-20-6120" rel="footnote2">20</a>

<p>On top of its protection and insulation benefits, the myelin sheath is a major factor in the pace of communication—action potentials travel <em>much </em>faster through axons when they&#8217;re covered in myelin sheath:<a href="#footnote-14-6120" id="note-14-6120" rel="footnote">14</a><a href="#footnote2-21-6120" id="note2-21-6120" rel="footnote2">21</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-6255 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>One nice example of the speed difference created by myelin: You know how when you stub your toe, your body gives you that one second of reflection time to think about what you just did and what you&#8217;re about to feel, before the pain actually kicks in? What&#8217;s happening is you feel both the sensation of your toe hitting against something and the sharp part of the pain right away, because sharp pain information is sent to the brain via types of axons that are myelinated. It takes a second or two for the dull pain to kick in because dull pain is sent via <em>unmyelinated</em> &#8220;C fibers&#8221;—at only around one meter/second.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Neural Networks</strong></span></p>
<p>Neurons are similar to computer transistors in one way—they also transmit information in the binary language of 1&#8217;s (action potential firing) and 0&#8217;s (no action potential firing). But unlike computer transistors, the brain&#8217;s neurons are constantly changing.</p>
<p>You know how sometimes you learn a new skill and you get pretty good at it, and then the next day you try again and you suck again? That&#8217;s because what made you get good at the skill the day before was adjustments to the amount or concentration of the <em>chemicals</em> in the signaling between neurons. Repetition caused chemicals to adjust, which helped you improve, but the next day the chemicals were back to normal so the improvement went away.</p>
<p>But then if you <em>keep </em>practicing, you eventually get good at something in a lasting way. What&#8217;s happened is you&#8217;ve told the brain, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t just something I need in a one-off way,&#8221; and the brain&#8217;s neural network has responded by making <em>structural changes</em> to itself that last. Neurons have shifted shape and location and strengthened or weakened various connections in a way that has built a hard-wired set of pathways that know how to do that skill.</p>
<p>Neurons&#8217; ability to alter themselves chemically, structurally, and even functionally, allow your brain&#8217;s neural network to optimize itself to the external world—a phenomenon called <em>neuroplasticity. </em>Babies&#8217; brains are the most neuroplastic of all. When a baby is born, its brain has no idea if it needs to accommodate the life of a medieval warrior who will need to become incredibly adept at sword-fighting, a 17th-century musician who will need to develop fine-tuned muscle memory for playing the harpsichord, or a modern-day intellectual who will need to store and organize a tremendous amount of information and master a complex social fabric—but the baby&#8217;s brain is ready to shape itself to handle whatever life has in store for it.</p>
<p>Babies are the neuroplasticity superstars, but neuroplasticity remains throughout our whole lives, which is why humans can grow and change and learn new things. And it&#8217;s why we can form new habits and break old ones—your habits are reflective of the existing circuitry in your brain. If you want to change your habits, you need to exert a lot of willpower to override your brain&#8217;s neural pathways, but if you can keep it going long enough, your brain will eventually get the hint and alter those pathways, and the new behavior will stop requiring willpower. Your brain will have physically built the changes into a new habit.</p>
<p>Altogether, there are around 100 billion neurons in the brain that make up this unthinkably vast network—similar to the number of stars in the Milky Way and over 10 times the number of people in the world. Around 15 &#8211; 20 billion of those neurons are in the cortex, and the rest are in the animal parts of your brain (surprisingly, the random cerebellum has more than three times as many neurons as the cortex).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s zoom back out and look at another cross section of the brain—this time cut not from front to back to show a single hemisphere, but from side to side:<a href="#footnote2-22-6120" id="note2-22-6120" rel="footnote2">22</a>

<p>Brain material can be divided into what’s called <strong>gray matter </strong>and <strong>white matter.</strong> Gray matter actually looks darker in color and is made up of the cell bodies (somas) of the brain&#8217;s neurons and their thicket of dendrites and axons—along with a lot of other stuff. White matter is made up primarily of wiring—axons carrying information from somas to other somas or to destinations in the body. White matter is white because those axons are usually wrapped in myelin sheath, which is fatty white tissue.</p>
<p>There are two main regions of gray matter in the brain—the internal cluster of limbic system and brain stem parts we discussed above, and the nickel-thick layer of cortex around the outside. The big chunk of white matter in between is made up mostly of the axons of cortical neurons. The cortex is like a great command center, and it beams many of its orders out through the mass of axons making up the white matter beneath it.</p>
<p>The coolest illustration of this concept that I&#8217;ve come across<a href="#footnote-15-6120" id="note-15-6120" rel="footnote">15</a> is a <a href="http://www.gregadunn.com/self-reflected/self-reflected-gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful set of artistic representations</a> done by Dr. Greg A. Dunn and Dr. Brian Edwards. Check out the distinct difference between the structure of the outer layer of gray matter cortex and the white matter underneath it (click to view in high res):</p>

<p>Those cortical axons might be taking information to another part of the cortex, to the lower part of the brain, or through the spinal cord—the nervous system&#8217;s superhighway—and into the rest of the body.<a href="#footnote-16-6120" id="note-16-6120" rel="footnote">16</a>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the whole nervous system:<a href="#footnote2-23-6120" id="note2-23-6120" rel="footnote2">23</a>

<p>The nervous system is divided into two parts: the <strong>central nervous system</strong>—your brain and spinal cord—and the <strong>peripheral nervous system</strong>—made up of the neurons that radiate outwards from the spinal cord into the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Most types of neurons are <strong>interneurons</strong>—neurons that communicate with other neurons. When you think, it&#8217;s a bunch of interneurons talking to each other. Interneurons are mostly contained to the brain.</p>
<p>The two other kinds of neurons are <strong>sensory neurons </strong>and <strong>motor neurons</strong>—those are the neurons that head down into your spinal cord and make up the peripheral nervous system. These neurons can be up to a <em>meter</em> long.<a href="#footnote-17-6120" id="note-17-6120" rel="footnote">17</a> Here&#8217;s a typical structure of each type:<a href="#footnote2-24-6120" id="note2-24-6120" rel="footnote2">24</a>

<p>Remember our two strips?<a href="#footnote2-25-6120" id="note2-25-6120" rel="footnote2">25</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/motor-cortex-of-the-brain-1505972E27C6C96B962.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6142 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/motor-cortex-of-the-brain-1505972E27C6C96B962.png" alt="" width="317" height="244" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/motor-cortex-of-the-brain-1505972E27C6C96B962.png 317w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/motor-cortex-of-the-brain-1505972E27C6C96B962-300x231.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></a></p>
<p>These strips are where your peripheral nervous system originates. The axons of sensory neurons head down from the somatosensory cortex, through the brain&#8217;s white matter, and into the spinal cord (which is just a massive bundle of axons). From the spinal cord, they head out to all parts of your body. Each part of your skin is lined with nerves that originate in the somatosensory cortex. A <strong>nerve</strong>, by the way, is a few bundles of axons wrapped together in a little cord. Here&#8217;s a nerve up close:<a href="#footnote2-26-6120" id="note2-26-6120" rel="footnote2">26</a>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6143 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/perner004os-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="500" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/perner004os-1.jpg 400w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/perner004os-1-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>The nerve is the whole thing circled in purple, and those four big circles inside are bundles of many axons (here&#8217;s a helpful <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/main-qimg-3f670c6ad3bb29728c912a1abbec2d26.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cartoony drawing</a>).</p>
<p>So if a fly lands on your arm, here&#8217;s what happens:</p>
<p>The fly touches your skin and stimulates a bunch of sensory nerves. The axon terminals in the nerves have a little fit and start action potential-ing, sending the signal up to the brain to tell on the fly. The signals head into the spinal cord and up to the somas in the somatosensory cortex.<a href="#footnote-18-6120" id="note-18-6120" rel="footnote">18</a> The somatosensory cortex then taps the motor cortex on the shoulder and tells it that there&#8217;s a fly on your arm and that it needs to deal with it (lazy). The particular somas in your motor cortex that connect to the muscles in your arm then start action potential-ing, sending the signals back into the spinal cord and then out to the muscles of the arm. The axon terminals at the end of those neurons stimulate your arm muscles, which constrict to shake your arm to get the fly off (by now the fly has already <a href="http://www.womansday.com/food-recipes/food-drinks/news/a50683/the-disgusting-reason-you-should-never-eat-something-a-fly-landed-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrown up</a> on your arm), and the fly (whose nervous system now goes through its own whole thing) flies off.</p>
<p>Then your amygdala looks over and realizes there was a bug on you, and it tells your motor cortex to jump embarrassingly, and if it&#8217;s a spider instead of a fly, it also tells your vocal cords to yell out involuntarily and ruin your reputation.</p>
<p>So it seems so far like we do kind of actually understand the brain, right? But then why did that professor ask that question—<em>If everything you need to know about the brain is a mile, how far have we walked in this mile?</em>—and say the answer was <em>three inches?</em></p>
<p>Well here&#8217;s the thing.</p>
<p>You know how we totally get how an individual computer sends an email and we totally understand the broad concepts of the internet, like how many people are on it and what the biggest sites are and what the major trends are—but all the stuff in the middle—the inner workings of the internet—are pretty confusing?</p>
<p>And you know how economists can tell you all about how an individual consumer functions and they can also tell you about the major concepts of macroeconomics and the overarching forces at play—but no one can really tell you all the ins and outs of how the economy works or predict what will happen with the economy next month or next year?</p>
<p>The brain is kind of like those things. We get the little picture—we know all about how a neuron fires. And we get the big picture—we know how many neurons are in the brain and what the major lobes and structures control and how much energy the whole system uses. But the stuff in between—all that <em>middle </em>stuff about how each part of the brain actually does its thing?</p>
<p>Yeah we don&#8217;t get that.</p>
<p>What really makes it clear how confounded we are is hearing a neuroscientist talk about the parts of the brain we understand <em>best</em>.</p>
<p>Like the visual cortex. We understand the visual cortex pretty well because it&#8217;s easy to <em>map</em>.</p>
<p>Research scientist Paul Merolla described it to me:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The visual cortex has very nice anatomical function and structure. When you look at it, you literally see a map of the world. So when something in your visual field is in a certain region of space, you’ll see a little patch in the cortex that represents that region of space, and it’ll light up. And as that thing moves over, there’s a topographic mapping where the neighboring cells will represent that. It’s almost like having Cartesian coordinates of the real world that will map to polar coordinates in the visual cortex. And you can literally trace from your retina, through your thalamus, to your visual cortex, and you’ll see an actual mapping from this point in space to this point in the visual cortex.</em></p>
<p class="p1">So far so good. But then he went on:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>So that mapping is really useful if you want to interact with certain parts of the visual cortex, but there’s many regions of vision, and as you get deeper into the visual cortex, it becomes a little bit more nebulous, and this topographic representation starts to break down. &#8230; There’s all these levels of things going on in the brain, and visual perception is a great example of that. We look at the world, and there’s just this physical 3D world out there—like you look at a cup, and you just see a cup—but what your eyes are seeing is really just a bunch of pixels. And when you look in the visual cortex, you see that there are roughly 20-40 different maps. V1 is the first area, where it’s tracking little edges and colors and things like that. And there’s other areas looking at more complicated objects, and there’s all these different visual representations on the surface of your brain, that you can see. And somehow all of that information is being bound together in this information stream that’s being coded in a way that makes you believe you’re just seeing a simple object.</em></p>
<p class="p1">And the motor cortex, another one of the best-understood areas of the brain, might be even more difficult to understand on a granular level than the visual cortex. Because even though we know which <em>general </em>areas of the motor cortex map to which areas of the body, the individual neurons in these motor cortex areas <em>aren&#8217;t</em> topographically set up, and the specific way they work together to create movement in the body is anything but clear. Here’s Paul again:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The neural chatter in everyone’s arm movement part of the brain is a little bit different—it’s not like the neurons speak English and say &#8220;move&#8221;—it’s a pattern of electrical activity, and in everyone it’s a little bit different. &#8230; And you want to be able to seamlessly understand that it means &#8220;Move the arm this way&#8221; or &#8220;move the arm toward the target&#8221; or &#8220;move the arm to the left, move it up, grasp, grasp with a certain kind of force, reach with a certain speed,&#8221; and so on. We don’t think about these things when we move—it just happens seamlessly. So each brain has a unique code with which it talks to the muscles in the arm and hand.</em></p>
<p class="p1">The <em>neuroplasticity </em>that makes our brains so useful to us also makes them incredibly difficult to understand—because the way each of our brains works is based on how that brain has shaped itself, based on its particular environment and life experience.</p>
<p class="p1">And again, those are the areas of the brain we understand the <em>best. </em>&#8220;When it comes to more sophisticated computation, like language, memory, mathematics,&#8221; one expert told me, &#8220;we really don’t understand how the brain works.&#8221; He lamented that, for example, the concept of one&#8217;s mother is coded in a different way, and in different parts of the brain, for every person. And in the<em> </em>frontal lobe—you know, that part of the brain where <em>you </em>really live—&#8221;there&#8217;s no topography at all.&#8221;<em> </em></p>
<p class="p1">But somehow, <em>none of this </em>is why building effective brain-computer interfaces is so hard, or so daunting. What makes BMIs so hard is that the engineering challenges are <em>monumental</em>. It&#8217;s <em>physically </em>working with the brain that makes BMIs among the hardest engineering endeavors in the world.</p>

<p class="p1">Alright, first let&#8217;s take Bok on a plane, and into a submarine, and to the top of the Burj Khalifa. Now we&#8217;ll show him a telescope and a TV and an iPhone. And now we&#8217;ll let him play around on the internet for a while.</p>
<p class="p1">Okay that was fun. How&#8217;d it go, Bok?</p>

<p>Bok would be shocked to learn that despite all the magical powers humans have gained as a result of having learned to speak to each other, when it comes to actually speaking to each other, we&#8217;re no more magical than the people of his day. When two people are together and talking, they&#8217;re using 50,000-year-old technology.</p>
<p class="p1">Bok might also be surprised that in a world run by fancy machines, the people who made all the machines are walking around with the same biological bodies that Bok and his friends walk around with. How can that be?</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok-11.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6298" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok-11.png" alt="" width="450" height="462" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok-11.png 797w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok-11-292x300.png 292w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok-11-768x788.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok-11-585x600.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p>This is why brain-machine interfaces—a subset of the broader field of neural engineering, which itself is a subset of biotechnology—are such a tantalizing new industry. We&#8217;ve conquered the world many times over with our technology, but when it comes to our brains—our most central tool—the tech world has for the most part been too daunted to dive in.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we still communicate using technology Bok invented, it&#8217;s why I&#8217;m typing this sentence at about a 20th of the speed that I&#8217;m thinking it, and it’s why brain-related ailments still leave so many lives badly impaired or lost altogether.</p>
<p>But 50,000 years after the brain&#8217;s great &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment, that may finally be about to change. The brain&#8217;s next great frontier may be itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>There are many kinds of potential brain-machine interface (sometimes called a brain-computer interface) that will serve many different functions. But everyone working on BMIs is grappling with either one or both of these two questions:</p>
<p><strong>1) How do I get the right information out of the brain?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) How do I send the right information into the brain?</strong></p>
<p>The first is about capturing the brain&#8217;s <em>output</em>—it&#8217;s about <strong>recording</strong> what neurons are saying.</p>
<p>The second is about <em>inputting </em>information into the brain&#8217;s natural flow or altering that natural flow in some other way—it&#8217;s about <strong>stimulating </strong>neurons.</p>
<p>These two things are happening naturally in your brain all the time. Right now, your eyes are making a specific set of horizontal movements that allow you to read this sentence. That&#8217;s the brain&#8217;s neurons outputting information to a machine (your eyes) and the machine receiving the command and responding. And as your eyes move in just the right way, the photons from the screen are entering your retinas and stimulating neurons in the occipital lobe of your cortex in a way that allows the image of the words to enter your mind&#8217;s eye. That image then stimulates neurons in another part of your brain that allows you to process the information embedded in the image and absorb the sentence&#8217;s meaning.</p>
<p>Inputting and outputting information is what the brain&#8217;s neurons <em>do</em>. All the BMI industry wants to do is get in on the action.</p>
<p>At first, this seems like maybe not <em>that </em>difficult a task? The brain is just a jello ball, right? And the cortex—the part of the brain in which we want to do most of our recording and stimulating—is just a napkin, located conveniently right on the outside of the brain where it can be easily accessed. Inside the cortex are around 20 billion firing neurons—20 billion oozy little transistors that if we can just learn to work with, will give us an entirely new level of control over our life, our health, and the world. Can&#8217;t we figure that out? Neurons are small, but we know how to split an atom. A neuron&#8217;s diameter is about 100,000 times as large as an atom&#8217;s—if an atom were a marble, a neuron would be a kilometer across—so we should probably be able to handle the smallness. Right?</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the issue here?</p>
<p>Well on one hand, there&#8217;s something to that line of thinking, in that because of those facts, this <em>is </em>an industry where immense progress can happen. We <em>can </em>do this.</p>
<p>But only when you understand what actually goes on in the brain do you realize why this is probably the hardest human endeavor in the world.</p>
<p>So before we talk about BMIs themselves, we need to take a closer look at what the people trying to make BMIs are dealing with here. I find that the best way to illustrate things is to scale the brain up by exactly 1,000X and look at what’s going on.</p>
<p>Remember our cortex-is-a-napkin demonstration earlier?</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6302" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png" alt="" width="500" height="424" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png 796w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-300x254.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-768x651.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-600x509.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Well if we scale that up by 1,000X, the cortex napkin—which was about 48cm / 19in on each side—now has a side the length of six Manhattan street blocks (or two avenue blocks). It would take you about 25 minutes to walk around the perimeter. And the brain as a whole would now fit snugly inside a two block by two block square—just about the size of Madison Square Garden (this works in length and width, but the brain would be about double the height of MSG).</p>

<p>So let’s lay it out in the actual city. I’m sure the few hundred thousand people who live there will understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-on-manhattan.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6267" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-on-manhattan.jpg" alt="" width="719" height="570" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-on-manhattan.jpg 1339w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-on-manhattan-300x238.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-on-manhattan-768x609.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-on-manhattan-600x476.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></a></p>
<p>I chose 1,000X as our multiplier for a couple reasons. One is that we can all instantly convert the sizes in our heads. Every millimeter of the actual brain is now a meter. And in the much smaller world of neurons, every micron is now an easy-to-conceptualize millimeter. Secondly, it conveniently brings the cortex up to human size—its 2mm thickness is now two meters—the height of a tall (6’6”) man.</p>
<p>So we could walk up to 29th street, to the edge of our giant cortex napkin, and easily look at what was going on inside those two meters of thickness. For our demonstration, let’s pull out a cubic meter of our giant cortex to examine, which will show us what goes on in a typical cubic millimeter of real cortex.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6301" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1.png" alt="" width="400" height="413" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1.png 1000w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1-290x300.png 290w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1-768x793.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1-581x600.png 581w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>What we’d see in that cubic meter would be a <em>mess. </em>Let’s empty it out and put it back together.</p>
<p>First, let’s put the somas<a href="#footnote-19-6120" id="note-19-6120" rel="footnote">19</a> in—the little bodies of all the neurons that live in that cube.</p>
<p>Somas range in size, but the neuroscientists I spoke with said that the somas of neurons in the cortex are often around 10 or 15µm in diameter (µm = micrometer, or micron: 1/1,000th of a millimeter). That means that if you laid out 7 or 10 of them in a line, that line would be about the diameter of a human hair (which is about 100µm). On our scale, that makes a soma 1 – 1.5cm in diameter. A marble.</p>
<p>The volume of the whole cortex is in the ballpark of 500,000 cubic millimeters, and in that space are about 20 billion somas. That means an average cubic millimeter of cortex contains about 40,000 neurons. So there are 40,000 marbles in our cubic meter box. If we divide our box into about 40,000 cubic spaces, each with a side of 3cm (or about a cubic inch), it means each of our soma marbles is at the center of its own little 3cm cube, with other somas about 3cm away from it in all directions.</p>
<p>With me so far? Can you visualize our meter cube with those 40,000 floating marbles in it?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a microscope image of the somas in an actual cortex, using techniques that block out the other stuff around them:<a href="#footnote2-27-6120" id="note2-27-6120" rel="footnote2">27</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6146 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="512" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094.jpg 312w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094-216x300.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></a></p>
<p>Okay not too crazy so far. But the soma is only a tiny piece of each neuron. Radiating out from each of our marble-sized somas are twisty, branchy dendrites that in our scaled-up brain can stretch out for three or four meters in many different directions, and from the other end an axon that can be over 100 meters long (when heading out laterally to another part of the cortex) or as long as a <em>kilometer</em> (when heading down into the spinal cord and body). Each of them only about a millimeter thick, these cords turn the cortex into a dense tangle of electrical spaghetti.</p>
<p>And there’s a lot going on in that mash of spaghetti. Each neuron has synaptic connections to as many as 1,000—sometimes as high as 10,000—other neurons. With around 20 billion neurons in the cortex, that means there are over 20 <em>trillion </em>individual neural connections in the cortex (and as high as a quadrillion connections in the entire brain). In our cubic meter alone, there will be over 20 million synapses.</p>
<p>To further complicate things, not only are there many spaghetti strands coming out of <em>each</em> of the 40,000 marbles in our cube, but there are thousands of other spaghetti strings passing through our cube from <em>other </em>parts of the cortex. That means that if we were trying to record signals or stimulate neurons in this particular cubic area, we’d have a lot of difficulty, because in the mess of spaghetti, it would be very hard to figure out which spaghetti strings belonged to <em>our </em>soma marbles (and god forbid there are <a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Purkinje_cell_by_Cajal.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Purkinje</em> cells</a> in the mix).</p>
<p>And of course, there’s the whole neuroplasticity thing. The voltages of each neuron would be constantly changing, as many as hundreds of times per second. And the tens of millions of synapse connections in our cube would be regularly changing sizes, disappearing, and reappearing.</p>
<p>If only that were the end of it.</p>
<p>It turns out there are other cells in the brain called <strong>glial cells</strong>—cells that come in many different varieties and perform many different functions, like mopping up chemicals released into synapses, wrapping axons in myelin, and serving as the brain&#8217;s immune system. Here are some common types of glial cell:<a href="#footnote2-28-6120" id="note2-28-6120" rel="footnote2">28</a>
<p><strong><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/all_glia.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6150 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/all_glia.jpg" alt="" width="759" height="185" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/all_glia.jpg 759w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/all_glia-300x73.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/all_glia-600x146.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" /></a></strong></p>
<p>And how many glial cells are in the cortex? About the <em>same number as there are neurons.</em><a href="#footnote-20-6120" id="note-20-6120" rel="footnote">20</a> So add about 40,000 of these wacky things into our cube.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the blood vessels. In every cubic millimeter of cortex, there&#8217;s a total of a <em>meter </em>of tiny blood vessels. On our scale, that means that in our cubic meter, there&#8217;s a <em>kilometer</em> of blood vessels. Here&#8217;s what the blood vessels in a space about that size look like:<a href="#footnote2-29-6120" id="note2-29-6120" rel="footnote2">29</a>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Connectome Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s an amazing project going on right now in the neuroscience world called the <a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human Connectome Project</a> (pronounced &#8220;connec-tome&#8221;) in which scientists are trying to create a complete detailed map of the entire human brain. Nothing close to this scale of brain mapping has ever been done.<a href="#footnote-21-6120" id="note-21-6120" rel="footnote">21</a>
<p>The project entails <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/science/28brain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slicing a human brain</a> into outrageously thin slices—around 30-<em>nano</em>meter-thick slices. That&#8217;s 1/33,000th of a millimeter (here&#8217;s a machine <a href="http://www.microscopedia.com/Content/Press/31977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slicing up</a> a mouse brain).</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to producing some <a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gorgeous images</a> of the &#8220;ribbon&#8221; formations axons with similar functions often form inside white matter, like—</p>

<p>—the connectome project has helped people visualize just how packed the brain is with all this stuff. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of all the different things going on in one tiny snippet of mouse brain (and this doesn&#8217;t even include the blood vessels):<a href="#footnote2-30-6120" id="note2-30-6120" rel="footnote2">30</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gr3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6153 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gr3.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="319" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gr3.jpg 656w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gr3-300x146.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gr3-600x292.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /></a></p>

<p>So our meter box is a jam-packed, oozy, electrified mound of dense complexity—now let’s recall that in reality, everything in our box actually fits in a cubic <em>millimeter.</em></p>
<p>And the brain-machine interface engineers need to figure out what the microscopic somas buried in that millimeter are saying, and other times, to stimulate <em>just </em>the right somas to get them to do what the engineers want. <em>Good luck with that.</em></p>
<p><em>We’d </em>have a super hard time doing that on our 1,000X brain. Our 1,000X brain that also happens to be a nice flat napkin. That’s not how it normally works—usually, the napkin is up on top of our Madison Square Garden brain and full of deep folds (on our scale, between five and 30 meters deep). In fact, less than a <em>third </em>of the cortex napkin is up on the surface of the brain—most is buried inside the folds.</p>
<p>Also, engineers are not operating on a bunch of brains in a lab. The brain is covered with all those Russian doll layers, including the skull—which at 1,000X would be around seven meters thick. And since most people don&#8217;t really want you opening up their skull for very long—and ideally not at all—you have to try to work with those tiny marbles as non-invasively as possible.</p>
<p>And this is all assuming you’re dealing with the cortex—but a lot of cool BMI ideas deal with the structures down below, which if you&#8217;re standing on top of our MSG brain, are buried 50 or 100 meters under the surface.</p>
<p>The 1,000X game also hammers home the sheer scope of the brain. Think about how much was going on in our cube—and now remember that that&#8217;s only<em> one 500,000th of the cortex</em>. If we broke our whole giant cortex into similar meter cubes and lined them up, they’d stretch 500km / 310mi—all the way to Boston and beyond. And if you made the trek—which would take over 100 hours of brisk walking—at any point you could pause and look at the cube you happened to be passing by and it would have all of this complexity inside of it. <em>All </em>of this is currently in your brain.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>Part 3A: How Happy Are You That This Isn&#8217;t Your Problem</strong></span></p>
<p>Totes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong>Back to Part 3: Brain-Machine Interfaces</strong></span></p>
<p>So how do scientists and engineers begin to manage this situation?</p>
<p>Well they do the best they can with the tools they currently have—tools used to record or stimulate neurons (we&#8217;ll focus on the recording side for the time being). Let’s take a look at the options:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>BMI Tools</strong></span></p>
<p>With the current work that&#8217;s being done, three broad criteria seem to stand out when evaluating a type of recording tool&#8217;s pros and cons:</p>
<p><strong>1) Scale </strong>&#8211; how many neurons can be simultaneously recorded</p>
<p><strong>2) Resolution </strong>&#8211; how detailed is the information the tool receives—there are two types of resolution, <strong>spatial</strong> (how closely your recordings come to telling you how individual neurons are firing) and <strong>temporal </strong>(how well you can determine <em>when </em>the activity you record happened)</p>
<p><strong>3) Invasiveness </strong>&#8211; is surgery needed, and if so, how extensively</p>
<p>The long-term goal is to have all three of your cakes and eat them all. But for now, it&#8217;s always a question of &#8220;which one (or two) of these criteria are you willing to completely fail?&#8221; Going from one tool to another isn&#8217;t an overall upgrade or downgrade—it&#8217;s a tradeoff.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s examine the types of tools currently being used:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>fMRI</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Scale: </strong>high (it shows you information across the whole brain)</p>
<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>medium-low spatial, very low temporal</p>
<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>non-invasive</p>
<p>fMRI isn&#8217;t typically used for BMIs, but it is a classic <em>recording </em>tool—it gives you information about what&#8217;s going on inside the brain.</p>
<p>fMRI uses MRI—magnetic resonance imaging—technology. MRIs, invented in the 1970s, were an evolution of the x-ray-based CAT scan. Instead of using x-rays, MRIs use magnetic fields (along with radio waves and other signals) to generate images of the body and brain. Like this:<a href="#footnote2-31-6120" id="note2-31-6120" rel="footnote2">31</a>

<p>Pretty amazing technology.</p>
<p>fMRI (&#8220;functional&#8221; MRI) uses similar technology to track changes in <em>blood flow</em>. Why? Because when areas of the brain become more active, they use more energy, so they need more oxygen—so blood flow increases to the area to deliver that oxygen. Blood flow indirectly indicates where activity is happening. Here&#8217;s what an fMRI scan might show:<a href="#footnote2-32-6120" id="note2-32-6120" rel="footnote2">32</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-6156 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520.jpg" alt="" width="323" height="323" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520.jpg 520w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520-150x150.jpg 150w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s always blood throughout the brain—what this image shows is where blood flow has <em>increased</em> (red/orange/yellow) and where it has <em>decreased </em>(blue). And because fMRI can scan through the whole brain, results are 3-dimensional:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fmriHeadCrossSection.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6157 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fmriHeadCrossSection.gif" alt="" width="256" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>fMRI has many medical uses, like informing doctors whether or not certain parts of the brain are functioning properly after a stroke, and fMRI has taught neuroscientists a ton about which regions of the brain are involved with which functions. Scans also have the benefit of providing info about what&#8217;s going on in the whole brain at any given time, and it&#8217;s safe and totally non-invasive.</p>
<p>The big drawback is resolution. fMRI scans have a literal resolution, like a computer screen has with pixels, except the pixels are three-dimensional, cubic volume pixels—or “voxels.&#8221;</p>
<p>fMRI voxels have gotten smaller as the technology has improved, bringing the spatial resolution up. Today&#8217;s fMRI voxels can be as small as a cubic millimeter. The brain has a volume of about 1,200,000mm<sup>3</sup>, so a high-resolution fMRI scan divides the brain into about one million little cubes. The problem is that on neuron scale, that&#8217;s still pretty huge (the same size as our scaled-up cubic meter above)—each voxel contains tens of thousands of neurons. So what the fMRI is showing you, at best, is the average blood flow drawn in by each group of 40,000 or so neurons.</p>
<p>The even bigger problem is temporal resolution. fMRI tracks blood flow, which is both imprecise and comes with a delay of about a second—an eternity in the world of neurons.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>EEG</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Scale: </strong>high</p>
<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>very low spatial, medium-high temporal</p>
<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>non-invasive</p>
<p>Dating back almost a century, EEG (electroencephalography) puts an array of electrodes on your head. You know, this whole thing:<a href="#footnote2-33-6120" id="note2-33-6120" rel="footnote2">33</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/EEG-cap-262x300.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6158 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/EEG-cap-262x300.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>EEG is definitely technology that will look hilariously primitive to a 2050 person, but for now, it&#8217;s one of the only tools that can be used with BMIs that&#8217;s totally non-invasive. EEGs record electrical activity in different regions of the brain, displaying the findings like this:<a href="#footnote2-34-6120" id="note2-34-6120" rel="footnote2">34</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human_EEG_with_prominent_alpha-rhythm.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6159" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human_EEG_with_prominent_alpha-rhythm.png" alt="" width="726" height="317" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human_EEG_with_prominent_alpha-rhythm.png 1284w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human_EEG_with_prominent_alpha-rhythm-300x131.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human_EEG_with_prominent_alpha-rhythm-768x335.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human_EEG_with_prominent_alpha-rhythm-600x262.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></a></p>
<p>EEG graphs can uncover information about medical issues like epilepsy, track sleep patterns, or be used to determine something like the status of a dose of anesthesia.</p>
<p>And unlike fMRI, EEG has pretty good temporal resolution, getting electrical signals from the brain right as they happen—though the skull blurs the temporal accuracy considerably (bone is a bad conductor).</p>
<p>The major drawback is spatial resolution. EEG has none. Each electrode only records a broad average—a vector sum of the charges from millions or billions of neurons (and a blurred one because of the skull).</p>
<p>Imagine that the brain is a baseball stadium, its neurons are the members of the crowd, and the information we want is, instead of electrical activity, vocal cord activity. In that case, EEG would be like a group of microphones placed outside the stadium, against the stadium&#8217;s outer walls. You&#8217;d be able to hear when the crowd was cheering and maybe predict the type of thing they were cheering about. You&#8217;d be able to hear telltale signs that it was between innings and maybe whether or not it was a close game. You could probably detect when something abnormal happened. But that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>ECoG</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Scale: </strong>high</p>
<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>low spatial, high temporal</p>
<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>kind of invasive</p>
<p>ECoG (electrocorticography) is a similar idea to EEG, also using surface electrodes—except they put them <em>under </em>the skull, on the surface of the brain.<a href="#footnote2-35-6120" id="note2-35-6120" rel="footnote2">35</a>

<p>Ick. But effective—at least much more effective than EEG. Without the interference of the skull blurring things, ECoG picks up both higher spatial (about 1cm) and temporal resolution (5 milliseconds). ECoG electrodes can either be placed above or below the dura:<a href="#footnote2-36-6120" id="note2-36-6120" rel="footnote2">36</a>

<p>Bringing back our stadium analogy, ECoG microphones are <em>inside </em>the stadium and a bit closer to the crowd. So the sound is much crisper than what EEG mics get from outside the stadium, and ECoG mics can better distinguish the sounds of individual sections of the crowd. But the improvement comes at a cost—it requires invasive surgery. In the scheme of invasive surgeries, though, it&#8217;s not so bad. As one neurosurgeon described to me, &#8220;You can slide stuff underneath the dura relatively non-invasively. You still have to make a hole in the head, but it’s relatively non-invasive.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Local Field Potential</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Scale: </strong>low</p>
<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>medium-low spatial, high temporal</p>
<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>very invasive</p>
<p>Okay here&#8217;s where we shift from surface electrode discs to microelectrodes—tiny needles surgeons stick into the brain.</p>
<p>Brain surgeon Ben Rapoport described to me how his father (a neurologist) used to make microelectrodes:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>When my father was making electrodes, he’d make them by hand. He’d take a very fine wire—like a gold or platinum or iridium wire, that was 10-30 microns in diameter, and he’d insert that wire in a glass capillary tube that was maybe a millimeter in diameter. Then they&#8217;d take that piece of glass over a flame and rotate it until the glass became soft. They&#8217;d stretch out the capillary tube until it&#8217;s incredibly thin, and then take it out of the flame and break it. Now the capillary tube is flush with and pinching the wire. The glass is an insulator and the wire is a conductor. So what you end up with is a glass-insulated stiff electrode that is maybe a few 10s of microns at the tip.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Today, while some electrodes are still made by hand, newer techniques use silicon wafers and manufacturing technology borrowed from the integrated circuits industry.</p>
<p class="p1">The way local field potentials (LFP) work is simple—you take one of these super thin needles with an electrode tip and stick it one or two millimeters into the cortex. There it picks up the average of the electrical charges from all of the neurons within a certain radius of the electrode.</p>
<p class="p1">LFP gives you the not-that-bad spatial resolution of the fMRI combined with the instant temporal resolution of an ECoG. Kind of the best of all the worlds described above when it comes to resolution.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, it does badly on both other criteria.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike fMRI, EEG, and ECoG, microelectrode LFP does not have scale—it <em>only</em> tells you what the little sphere surrounding it is doing. And it&#8217;s far more invasive, actually entering the brain.</p>
<p class="p1">In the baseball stadium, LFP is a single microphone hanging over a single section of seats, picking up a crisp feed of the sounds in that area, and maybe picking out an individual voice for a second here and there—but otherwise only getting the general vibe.</p>
<p class="p1">A more recent development is the <strong>multielectrode array, </strong>which is the same idea as the LFP except it&#8217;s about 100 LFPs all at once, in a single area of the cortex. A multielectrode array looks like this:<a href="#footnote2-37-6120" id="note2-37-6120" rel="footnote2">37</a>

<p class="p1"><strong style="font-size: 16pt;">Single-Unit Recording</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scale: </strong>tiny</p>
<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>super high</p>
<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>very invasive</p>
<p>To record a broader LFP, the electrode tip is a bit rounded to give the electrode more surface area, and they turn the resistance down with the intent of allowing very faint signals from a wide range of locations to be picked up. The end result is the electrode picks up a chorus of activity from the local field.</p>
<p>Single-unit recording also uses a needle electrode, but they make the tip super sharp and crank up the resistance. This wipes out most of the noise and leaves the electrode picking up almost nothing—until it finds itself <em>so </em>close to a neuron (maybe 50µm away) that the signal from that neuron is strong enough to make it past the electrode&#8217;s high resistance wall. With distinct signals from one neuron and no background noise, this electrode can now voyeur in on the private life of a single neuron. Lowest possible scale, highest possible resolution.</p>
<p>By the way, you can listen to a neuron fire <span class="s1"><span class="s2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bxpz-YEuao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (what you’re actually hearing is the electro-chemical firing of a neuron, converted to audio).</span></span></p>
<p>Some electrodes want to take the relationship to the next level and will go for a technique called the <strong>patch clamp</strong>, whereby it&#8217;ll get rid of its electrode tip, leaving just a tiny little tube called a glass pipette,<a href="#footnote-22-6120" id="note-22-6120" rel="footnote">22</a> and it&#8217;ll actually directly assault a neuron by sucking a &#8220;patch&#8221; of its membrane into the tube, allowing for even finer measurements:<a href="#footnote2-39-6120" id="note2-39-6120" rel="footnote2">39</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2009_06a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6164 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2009_06a.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="278" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2009_06a.jpg 325w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2009_06a-300x257.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></a></p>
<p>A patch clamp also has the benefit that, unlike all the other methods we&#8217;ve discussed, because it&#8217;s physically touching the neuron, it can not only record but <em>stimulate </em>the neuron,<a href="#footnote-23-6120" id="note-23-6120" rel="footnote">23</a> injecting current or holding voltage at a set level to do specific tests (other methods can stimulate neurons, but only entire groups together).</p>
<p>Finally, electrodes can fully defile the neuron and actually penetrate through the membrane, which is called <strong>sharp electrode recording. </strong>If the tip is sharp enough, this won&#8217;t destroy the cell—the membrane will actually seal around the electrode, making it very easy to stimulate the neuron or record the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the neuron. But this is a short-term technique—a punctured neuron won&#8217;t survive long.</p>
<p>In our stadium, a single unit recording is a one-directional microphone clipped to a single crowd member&#8217;s collar. A patch clamp or sharp recording is a mic in someone&#8217;s throat, registering the exact movement of their vocal cords. This is a great way to learn about that person&#8217;s experience at the game, but it also gives you no context, and you can&#8217;t really tell if the sounds and reactions of that person are representative of what&#8217;s going on in the game.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s about what we&#8217;ve got, at least in common usage. These tools are simultaneously unbelievably advanced and what will seem like Stone Age technology to future humans, who won&#8217;t believe you had to choose <em>either </em>high-res <em>or </em>a wide field and that you actually had to open someone&#8217;s <em>skull </em>to get high-quality brain readouts or write-ins.</p>
<p>But given their limitations, these tools have taught us worlds about the brain and led to the creation of some amazing early BMIs. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s already out there—</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>The BMIs we already have</strong></span></p>
<p>In 1969, a researcher named Eberhard Fetz connected a single neuron in a monkey&#8217;s brain to a dial in front of the monkey&#8217;s face. The dial would move when the neuron was fired. When the monkey would think in a way that fired the neuron and the dial would move, he&#8217;d get a banana-flavored pellet. Over time, the monkey started getting <em>better </em>at the game because he wanted more delicious pellets. The monkey had learned to make the neuron fire and inadvertently became the subject of the first real brain-machine interface.</p>
<p>Progress was slow over the next few decades, but by the mid-90s, things had started to move, and it&#8217;s been quietly accelerating ever since.</p>
<p>Given that both our understanding of the brain and the electrode hardware we&#8217;ve built are pretty primitive, our efforts have typically focused on building straightforward interfaces to be used with the areas of the brain we understand the best, like the motor cortex and the visual cortex.</p>
<p>And given that human experimentation is only really possible for people who are trying to use BMIs to alleviate an impairment—and because that&#8217;s currently where the market demand is—our efforts have focused so far almost entirely on restoring lost function to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The major BMI industries of the future that will give all humans magical superpowers and transform the world are in their fetal stage right now—and we should look at what&#8217;s being worked on as a set of clues about what the mind-boggling worlds of 2040 and 2060 and 2100 might be like.</p>

<p>—and try to imagine what the blank looks like. And we&#8217;ll come back to the blank later in the post.</p>
<p>Anyway, from everything I&#8217;ve read about and discussed with people in the field, there seem to be three major categories of brain-machine interface being heavily worked on right now:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Early BMI type #1: Using the motor cortex as a remote control</strong></span></p>
<p>In case you forgot this from 9,000 words ago, the motor cortex is this guy:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ucNSNTDc4yMxayeRNXNlpw_m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6133 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ucNSNTDc4yMxayeRNXNlpw_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>All areas of the brain confuse us, but the motor cortex confuses us less than almost all the other areas. And most importantly, it&#8217;s <em>well-mapped</em>, meaning specific parts of it control specific parts of the body (remember the upsetting <a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/152-KB-Homonculus-Sensory-and-Motor-Cortex.png" target="_blank" rel="” noopener noreferrer">homunculus?</a>).</p>
<p>Also importantly, it&#8217;s one of the major areas of the brain in charge of our <em>output</em>. When a human <em>does </em>something, the motor cortex is almost always the one pulling the strings (at least for the physical part of the doing). So the human brain doesn&#8217;t really have to <em>learn </em>to use the motor cortex as a remote control, because the brain already uses the motor cortex as its remote control.</p>
<p>Lift your hand up. Now put it down. See? Your hand is like a little toy drone, and your brain just picked up the motor cortex remote control and used it to make the drone fly up and then back down.</p>
<p>The goal of motor cortex-based BMIs is to tap into the motor cortex, and then when the remote control fires a command, to <em>hear </em>that command and then send it to some kind of machine that can respond to it the way, say, your hand would. A bundle of nerves is the middleman between your motor cortex and your hand. BMIs are the middleman between your motor cortex and a computer. Simple.</p>
<p>One barebones type of interface allows a human—often a person paralyzed from the neck down or someone who has had a limb amputated—to move a cursor on a screen with only their thoughts.</p>
<p>This begins with a 100-pin multielectrode array being implanted in the person&#8217;s motor cortex. The motor cortex in a paralyzed person usually works just fine—it&#8217;s just that the spinal cord, which had served as the middleman between the cortex and the body, stopped doing its job. So with the electrode array implanted, researchers have the person <em>try </em>to move their arm in different directions. Even though they can&#8217;t do that, the motor cortex still fires normally, as if they can.</p>
<p>When someone moves their arm, their motor cortex bursts into a flurry of activity—but each neuron is usually only interested in one type of movement. So one neuron might fire whenever the person moves their arm to the right—but it&#8217;s bored by other directions and is less active in those cases. That neuron alone, then, could tell a computer when the person wants to move their arm to the right and when they don&#8217;t. But that&#8217;s all. But with an electrode <em>array</em>, 100 single-unit electrodes each listen to a different neuron.<a href="#footnote-24-6120" id="note-24-6120" rel="footnote">24</a> So when they do testing, they&#8217;ll ask the person to try to move their arm to the right, and maybe 38 of the 100 electrodes detect their neuron firing. When the person tries to go left with their arm, maybe 41 others fire. After going through a bunch of different movements and directions and speeds, a computer takes the data from the electrodes and synthesizes it into a general understanding of which firing patterns correspond to which movement intentions on an X-Y axis.</p>
<p>Then when they link up that data to a computer screen, the person can use their mind, via &#8220;trying&#8221; to move the cursor, to really control the cursor. And this actually works. Through the work of motor-cortex-BMI pioneer company <a href="https://www.braingate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrainGate</a>, here&#8217;s a guy playing a video game using only his mind.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJJPbpHoPWo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>And if 100 neurons can tell you where they want to move a cursor, why couldn&#8217;t they tell you when they want to pick up a mug of coffee and take a sip? That&#8217;s what this quadriplegic woman did:</p>

<p>And why stop with arms? Brazilian BMI pioneer <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/miguel_nicolelis_brain_to_brain_communication_has_arrived_how_we_did_it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miguel Nicolelis</a> and his team built an entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=76&amp;v=mg8TAJdQKyY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exoskeleton</a> that allowed a paralyzed man to make the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inCvbDLfXBo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening kick</a> of the World Cup.<a href="#footnote-25-6120" id="note-25-6120" rel="footnote">25</a>
<div class="wbwAside">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Proprioception Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>Moving these kinds of &#8220;neuroprosthetics&#8221; is all about the recording of neurons, but for these devices to be truly effective, this needs to not be a one-way street, but a <em>loop </em>that includes recording <em>and </em>stimulation pathways. We don&#8217;t really think about this, but a huge part of your ability to pick up an object is all of the incoming sensory information your hand&#8217;s skin and muscles send back in (called &#8220;proprioception&#8221;). In one video I saw, a woman with numbed fingers tried to light a match, and it was almost impossible for her to do it, despite having no other disabilities. And the beginning of <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x12647t_the-man-who-lost-his-body-bbc-documentary_tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> shows the physical struggles of a man with a perfectly functional motor cortex but impaired proprioception. So for something like a bionic arm to really feel like an arm, and to really be useful, it needs to be able to send sensory information back in.</p>
<p>Stimulating neurons is even harder than recording them. As researcher Flip Sabes explained to me:</p>
<p><em>If I record a pattern of activity, it doesn’t mean I can readily recreate that pattern of activity by just playing it back. You can compare it to the planets in the Solar System. You can watch the planets move around and record their movements. But then if you jumble them all up and later want to recreate the original motion of one of the planets, you can’t just take that one planet and put it back into its orbit, because it’ll be influenced by all the other planets. Likewise, neurons aren’t just working in isolation—so there’s a fundamental irreversibility there. On top of that, with all of the axons and dendrites, it&#8217;s hard to just stimulate the neurons you want to—because when you try, you’ll hit a whole jumble of them.</em></p>
<p>Flip&#8217;s lab tries to deal with these challenges by getting the brain to help out. It turns out that if you reward a monkey with a succulent sip of orange juice when a single neuron fires, eventually the monkey will learn to make the neuron fire on demand. The neuron could then act as another kind of remote control. This means that normal motor cortex commands are only one possibility as a control mechanism. Likewise, until BMI technology gets good enough to perfect stimulation, you can use the brain&#8217;s neuroplasticity as a shortcut. If it&#8217;s too hard to make someone&#8217;s bionic fingertip touch something and send back information that feels just like the kind of sensation their own fingertip used to give them, the arm could instead send some <em>other </em>signal into the brain. At first, this would seem odd to the patient—but eventually the brain can learn to treat that signal as a new sense of touch. This concept is called &#8220;sensory substitution&#8221; and makes the brain a collaborator in BMI efforts.</p>
</div>
<p>In these developments are the seeds of other future breakthrough technologies—like brain-to-brain communication.</p>
<p>Nicolelis created an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584574/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiment</a> where the motor cortex of one rat in Brazil was wired, via the internet, to the motor cortex of another rat in the US. The rat in Brazil was presented with two transparent boxes, each with a lever attached to it, and inside one of the boxes would be a treat. To attempt to get the treat, the rat would press the lever of the box that held the treat. Meanwhile, the rat in the US was in a similar cage with two similar boxes, except unlike the rat in Brazil, the boxes weren&#8217;t transparent and offered him no information about which of his two levers would yield a treat and which wouldn&#8217;t. The only info the US rat had were the signals his brain received from the Brazil rat&#8217;s motor cortex. The Brazil rat had the key knowledge—but the way the experiment worked, the rats only received treats when the US rat pressed the correct lever. If he pulled the wrong one, neither would. The amazing thing is that over time, the rats got <em>better</em> at this and began to work together, almost like a single nervous system—even though neither had any idea the other rat existed. The US rat&#8217;s success rate at choosing the correct lever with no information would have been 50%. With the signals coming from the Brazil rat&#8217;s brain, the success rate jumped to 64%. (Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2_1dzwnNwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of the rats doing their thing.)</p>
<p>This has even worked, crudely, in people. Two people, in separate buildings, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked together</a> to play a video game. One could <em>see </em>the game, the other had the controller. Using simple EEG headsets, the player who could see the game would, without moving his hand, <em>think </em>about moving his hand to press the &#8220;shoot&#8221; button on a controller. Because their brains&#8217; devices were communicating with each other, the player with the controller would then feel a twitch in his finger and press the shoot button.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Early BMI type #2: Artificial ears and eyes</strong></span></p>
<p>There are a couple reasons giving sound to the deaf and sight to the blind is among the more manageable BMI categories.</p>
<p>The first is that like the motor cortex, the sensory cortices are parts of the brain we tend to understand pretty well, partly because they too tend to be well-mapped.</p>
<p>The second is that in many early applications, we don&#8217;t <em>really </em>need to deal with the brain—we can just deal with the place where ears and eyes <em>connect </em>to the brain, since that&#8217;s often where the impairment is based.</p>
<p>And while the motor cortex stuff was mostly about <em>recording </em>neurons to get information <em>out</em> of the brain, artificial senses go the other way—<em>stimulation</em> of neurons to send information <em>in.</em></p>
<p>On the ears side of things, recent decades have seen the development of the groundbreaking <strong>cochlear implant</strong>. <strong> </strong></p>
<div class="wbwAside">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The How Hearing Works Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>When you think you&#8217;re &#8220;hearing&#8221; &#8220;sound,&#8221; here&#8217;s what&#8217;s actually happening:</p>
<p>What we think of as sound is actually patterns of vibrations in the air molecules around your head. When a guitar string or someone&#8217;s vocal cords or the wind or anything else makes a sound, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s vibrating, which pushes nearby air molecules into a similar vibration and that pattern expands outward in a sphere, kind of like the surface of water expands outward in a circular ripple when something touches it.<a href="#footnote-26-6120" id="note-26-6120" rel="footnote">26</a>
<p>Your ear is a machine that converts those air vibrations into electrical impulses. Whenever air (or water, or any other medium whose molecules can vibrate) enters your ear, your ear translates the precise way it&#8217;s vibrating into an electrical code that it sends into the nerve endings that touch it. This causes those nerves to fire a pattern of action potentials that send the code into your auditory cortex for processing. Your brain receives the information, and we call the experience of receiving that particular type of information &#8220;hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most people who are deaf or hard of hearing don&#8217;t have a nerve problem or an auditory cortex problem—they usually have an ear problem. Their brain is as ready as anyone else&#8217;s to turn electrical impulses into hearing—it&#8217;s just that their auditory cortex isn&#8217;t <em>receiving</em> any electrical impulses in the first place, because the machine that converts air vibrations into those impulses isn&#8217;t doing its job.</p>
<p>The ear has a lot of parts, but it&#8217;s the cochlea in particular that makes the key conversion. When vibrations enter the fluid in the cochlea, it causes thousands of tiny hairs lining the cochlea to vibrate, and the cells those hairs are attached to transform the mechanical energy of the vibrations into electrical signals that then excite the auditory nerve. Here&#8217;s what it all looks like:<a href="#footnote2-40-6120" id="note2-40-6120" rel="footnote2">40</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6170 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna.jpg" alt="" width="577" height="492" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna.jpg 800w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna-300x256.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna-768x655.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna-600x512.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></a></p>
<p>The cochlea also sorts the incoming sound by frequency. Here&#8217;s a cool chart that shows why lower sounds are processed at the end of the cochlea and high sounds are processed at the beginning (and also why there&#8217;s a minimum and maximum frequency on what the ear can hear):<a href="#footnote2-41-6120" id="note2-41-6120" rel="footnote2">41</a>

</div>
<p>A cochlear implant is a little computer that has a microphone coming out of one end (which sits on the ear) and a wire coming out of the other that connects to an array of electrodes that line the cochlea. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/62036062.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6171" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/62036062.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="485" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/62036062.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/62036062-300x261.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/62036062-768x669.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/62036062-600x522.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></a></p>
<p>So sound comes into the microphone (the little hook on top of the ear), and goes into the brown thing, which processes the sound to filter out the less useful frequencies. Then the brown thing transmits the information through the skin, through electrical induction, to the computer&#8217;s other component, which converts the info into electric impulses and sends them into the cochlea. The electrodes filter the impulses by frequency just like the cochlea and stimulate the auditory nerve just like the hairs on the cochlea do. This is what it looks like from the outside:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/processor-on-ear.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6166 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/processor-on-ear.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="337" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/processor-on-ear.jpg 392w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/processor-on-ear-300x258.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></a></p>
<p>In other words, an artificial ear, performing the same sound-to-impulses-to-auditory-nerve function the ear does.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/00WOao4kpwM?t=3m15s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out what sound sounds</a> like to someone with the implant.</p>
<p>Not great. Why? Because to send sound into the brain with the richness the ear hears with, you&#8217;d need 3,500 electrodes. Most cochlear implants have about 16.<a href="#footnote-27-6120" id="note-27-6120" rel="footnote">27</a> Crude.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re in the Pilot ACE era—so of course it&#8217;s crude.</p>
<p>Still, today&#8217;s cochlear implant allows deaf people to hear <em>speech</em> and have conversations, which is a groundbreaking development.<a href="#footnote-28-6120" id="note-28-6120" rel="footnote">28</a>
<p>Many parents of deaf babies are now having a cochlear implant put in when the baby&#8217;s about one year old. Like this baby, whose reaction to hearing for the first time is <em>cute</em>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a similar revolution underway in the world of blindness, in the form of the <strong>retinal implant</strong>.</p>
<p>Blindness is often the result of a retinal disease. When this is the case, a retinal implant can perform a similar function for sight as a cochlear implant does for hearing (though less directly). It performs the normal duties of the eye and hands things off to nerves in the form of electrical impulses, just like the eye does.</p>
<p>A more complicated interface than the cochlear implant, the first retinal implant was approved by the FDA in 2011—the Argus II implant, made by <a href="http://www.secondsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Second Sight</a>. The retinal implant looks like this:<a href="#footnote2-42-6120" id="note2-42-6120" rel="footnote2">42</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6x6-argus-retinal-implant_2d.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6172 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6x6-argus-retinal-implant_2d.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="312" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6x6-argus-retinal-implant_2d.jpg 370w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6x6-argus-retinal-implant_2d-150x150.jpg 150w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6x6-argus-retinal-implant_2d-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /></a></p>
<p>And it works like this:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bi_HpbFKnSw?start=2&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The retinal implant has 60 sensors. The retina has around a million neurons. Crude. But seeing vague edges and shapes and patterns of light and dark sure beats seeing nothing at all. What&#8217;s encouraging is that you don&#8217;t need a million sensors to gain a reasonable amount of sight—simulations suggest that 600-1,000 electrodes would be enough for reading and facial recognition.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Early BMI type #3: Deep brain stimulation</strong></span></p>
<p>Dating back to the late 1980s, deep brain stimulation is yet another crude tool that is also still pretty life-changing for a lot of people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a type of category of BMI that doesn&#8217;t involve communication with the outside world—it&#8217;s about using brain-machine interfaces to treat or enhance yourself by altering something internally.</p>
<p>What happens here is one or two electrode wires, usually with <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ieee_pilot/articles/96jproc07/96jproc07-liker/assets/img/article_1/fig_2/small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four separate electrode sites</a>, are inserted into the brain, often ending up somewhere in the limbic system. Then a little pacemaker computer is implanted in the upper chest and wired to the electrodes. Like this unpleasant man:<a href="#footnote2-43-6120" id="note2-43-6120" rel="footnote2">43</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/StJudeMedicalDBSStory.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6173 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/StJudeMedicalDBSStory.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="400" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/StJudeMedicalDBSStory.jpg 350w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/StJudeMedicalDBSStory-263x300.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a></p>
<p>The electrodes can then give a little zap when called for, which can do a variety of important things. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the tremors of people with Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</li>
<li>Reduce the severity of seizures</li>
<li>Chill people with OCD out</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s also experimentally (not yet FDA approved) been able to mitigate certain kinds of chronic pain like migraines or phantom limb pain, treat anxiety or depression or PTSD, or even be combined with muscle stimulation elsewhere in the body to restore and retrain circuits that were broken down from stroke or a neurological disease.</p>

<p><a name="part4"></a>This is the state of the early BMI industry, and it&#8217;s the moment when Elon Musk is stepping into it. For him, and for Neuralink, today&#8217;s BMI industry is Point A. We&#8217;ve spent the whole post so far in the past, building up to the present moment. Now it&#8217;s time to step into the future—to figure out what Point B is and how we&#8217;re going to get there.</p>

<p>Having already written about two of Elon Musk&#8217;s companies—<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla</a> and <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpaceX</a>—I think I understand his formula. It looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Elon-company-formula-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6315" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Elon-company-formula-1.png" alt="" width="750" height="516" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Elon-company-formula-1.png 1800w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Elon-company-formula-1-300x207.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Elon-company-formula-1-768x529.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Elon-company-formula-1-600x413.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Elon-company-formula-1-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>And his initial thinking about a new company always starts on the right and works its way left.</p>
<p>He decides that some specific change in the world will increase the likelihood of humanity having the best possible future. He knows that large-scale world change happens quickest when the whole world—the Human Colossus—is working on it. And he knows that the Human Colossus will work toward a goal if (and only if) there&#8217;s an economic forcing function in place—if it&#8217;s a good business decision to spend resources innovating toward that goal.</p>
<p>Often, before a booming industry starts booming, it&#8217;s like a pile of logs—it has all the ingredients of a fire and it&#8217;s ready to go—but there&#8217;s no match. There&#8217;s some technological shortcoming that&#8217;s preventing the industry from taking off.</p>
<p>So when Elon builds a company, its core initial strategy is usually to create the match that will ignite the industry and get the Human Colossus working on the cause. This, in turn, Elon believes, will lead to developments that will change the world in the way that increases the likelihood of humanity having the best possible future. But you have to look at his companies from a zoomed-out perspective to see all of this. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll mistake what they do as their business for what they <em>do</em>—when in fact, what they do as their business is usually a mechanism to sustain the company while it innovates to try to make that critical match.</p>
<p>Back when I was working on the Tesla and SpaceX posts, I asked Elon why he went into engineering and not science, and he explained that when it comes to progress, &#8220;engineering is the limiting factor.&#8221; In other words, the progress of science, business, and industry are all at the whim of the progress of engineering. If you look at history, this makes sense—behind each of the greatest revolutions in human progress is an engineering breakthrough. A match.</p>

<p>So to understand an Elon Musk company, you need to think about the match he&#8217;s trying to create—along with three other variables:</p>

<p>And when I started trying to figure out what Neuralink was all about, I knew those were the variables I needed to fill in. At the time, I had only had the chance to get a very vague idea of one of the variables—that the goal of the company was &#8220;to accelerate the advent of a whole-brain interface.&#8221; Or what I&#8217;ve come to think of as a wizard hat.</p>

<p>As I understood it, a whole-brain interface was what a brain-machine interface would be in an ideal world—a super-advanced concept where essentially all the neurons in your brain are able to communicate seamlessly with the outside world. It was a concept loosely based on the science fiction idea of a &#8220;neural lace,&#8221;<em> </em>described in Iain Banks&#8217; <em>Culture</em> series<em>—</em>a massless, volumeless, whole-brain interface that can be teleported into the brain.</p>
<p>I had a lot of questions.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was on my way to San Francisco, where I had plans to sit down with half of Neuralink&#8217;s founding team and be the dumbest person in the room.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The I&#8217;m Not Being Self-Deprecating I Really Was Definitely the Dumbest Person in the Room Just Look at This Shit Blue Box</strong></span></p>
<p>The Neuralink team:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://paulmerolla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Merolla</a></strong>, who spent the last seven years as the lead chip designer at IBM on their SyNAPSE program, where he led the development of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueNorth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrueNorth chip</a>—one of the largest CMOS devices ever designed by transistor count nbd. Paul told me his field was called <em>neuromorphic, </em>where the goal is to design transistor circuits based on principles of brain architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://neurotech.llnl.gov/people/vanessa-tolosa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://neurotech.llnl.gov/people/vanessa-tolosa&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1494378603670000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEr4gvUHyKt2Ri6NQEmFmA6V7nCA"><strong>Vanessa Tolosa</strong></a>, Neuralink&#8217;s microfabrication expert and one of the world&#8217;s foremost researchers on biocompatible materials. Vanessa&#8217;s work involves designing biocompatible materials based on principles from the integrated circuits industry.</p>
<p><strong>Max Hodak</strong>, who worked on the development of some groundbreaking BMI technology at Miguel Nicolelis&#8217;s lab at Duke while also commuting across the country twice a week in college to run <a href="https://www.transcriptic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transcriptic</a>, the &#8220;robotic cloud laboratory for the life sciences&#8221; he founded.</p>
<p><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~djseo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>DJ Seo</strong></a>, who while at UC Berkeley in his mid-20s designed a cutting-edge new BMI concept called <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/08/03/sprinkling-of-neural-dust-opens-door-to-electroceuticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neural dust</a>—tiny ultrasound sensors that could provide a new way to record brain activity.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://weillcornellbrainandspine.org/residents/benjamin-rapoport-md-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Rapoport</a></strong>, Neuralink&#8217;s surgery expert, and a top neurosurgeon himself. But he also has a PhD in Electrical Engineering from MIT, allowing him to see his work as a neurosurgeon &#8220;through the lens of implantable devices.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/directory/zoom?PersonID=1376947129&amp;URLnode=70" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Hanson</a></strong>, whom a colleague described as &#8220;one of the best all-around engineers on the planet&#8221; and who self-taught himself enough about materials science and microfabrication methods to develop some of the core technology that&#8217;ll be used at Neuralink.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/philip.sabes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flip Sabes</a></strong>, a leading researcher whose lab at UCSF<strong> </strong>has pioneered new ground in BMIs by combining &#8220;cortical physiology, computational and theoretical modeling, and human psychophysics and physiology.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bu.edu/biology/people/profiles/tim-gardner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Gardner</a></strong>, a leading researcher at BU, whose lab works on implanting BMIs in <em>birds</em>, in order to study &#8220;how complex songs are assembled from elementary neural units&#8221; and learn about &#8220;the relationships between patterns of neural activity on different time-scales.&#8221; Both Tim and Flip have left tenured positions to join the Neuralink team—pretty good testament to the promise they believe this company has.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Elon, both as their CEO and a fellow team member. Elon being CEO makes this different from other recent things he&#8217;s started and puts Neuralink on the top tier for him, where only SpaceX and Tesla have lived. When it comes to neuroscience, Elon has the least technical knowledge on the team—but he also started SpaceX without very much technical knowledge and quickly became a certifiable rocket science expert by reading and by asking questions of the experts on the team. That&#8217;ll probably happen again here. (And for good reason—he pointed out: &#8220;Without a strong technical understanding, I think it’s hard to make the right decisions.&#8221;)</p>
</div>
<p>I asked Elon about how he brought this team together. He said that he met with literally over 1,000 people in order to assemble this group, and that part of the challenge was the large number of totally separate areas of expertise required when you&#8217;re working on technology that involves neuroscience, brain surgery, microscopic electronics, clinical trials, etc. Because it was such a cross-disciplinary area, he looked for cross-disciplinary experts. And you can see that in those bios—everyone brings their own unique crossover combination to a group that together has the rare ability to think as a single mega-expert. Elon also wanted to find people who were totally on board with the zoomed-out mission—who were more focused on industrial results than producing white papers. Not an easy group to assemble.</p>
<p>But there they were, sitting around the table looking at me, as it hit me 40 seconds in that I should have done a lot more research before coming here.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6412" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="551" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2.png 1239w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2-300x275.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2-768x705.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2-600x551.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>They took the hint and dumbed it down about four notches, and as the discussion went on, I started to wrap my head around things. Throughout the next few weeks, I met with each of the remaining Neuralink founders as well, each time playing the role of the dumbest person in the room. In these meetings, I focused on trying to form a comprehensive picture of the challenges at hand and what the road to a wizard hat might look like. I really wanted to understand these two boxes:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6450" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02.png" alt="" width="800" height="551" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02.png 1800w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-300x207.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-768x529.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-600x413.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>The first one was easy. The <em>business </em>side of Neuralink is a brain-machine interface development company. They want to create cutting-edge BMIs—what one of them referred to as &#8220;micron-sized devices.&#8221; Doing this will support the growth of the company while also providing a perfect vehicle for putting their innovations into practice (the same way SpaceX uses their launches both to sustain the company and experiment with their newest engineering developments).</p>
<p>As for what kind of interface they&#8217;re planning to work on first, here&#8217;s what Elon said:</p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">We are aiming to bring something to market that helps with certain severe brain injuries (stroke, cancer lesion, congenital) in about four years. </span></em></p>
<p>The second box was a lot hazier. It seems obvious to us today that using steam engine technology to harness the power of fire was the thing that had to happen to ignite the Industrial Revolution. But if you talked to someone in 1760 about it, they would have had a lot less clarity—on exactly which hurdles they were trying to get past, what kinds of innovations would allow them to leap over those hurdles, or how long any of this would take. And that&#8217;s where we are here—trying to figure out what the match looks like that will ignite the neuro revolution and how to create it.</p>
<p>The starting place for a discussion about innovation is a discussion about hurdles—what are you even trying to innovate <em>past? </em>In Neuralink&#8217;s case, a whole lot of things. But given that, here too, engineering will likely prove to be the limiting factor, here are some seemingly large challenges that probably <em>won&#8217;t</em> end up being the major roadblock:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Public skepticism </strong></span></p>
<p>Pew recently conducted a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/07/26/u-s-public-wary-of-biomedical-technologies-to-enhance-human-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">survey</a> asking Americans about which future biotechnologies give them the shits the most. It turns out BMIs worry Americans even more than gene editing:<a href="#footnote2-44-6120" id="note2-44-6120" rel="footnote2">44</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PS_2016.07.26_Human-Enhancement-Survey_0-01.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6181 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PS_2016.07.26_Human-Enhancement-Survey_0-01.png" alt="" width="415" height="413" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PS_2016.07.26_Human-Enhancement-Survey_0-01.png 415w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PS_2016.07.26_Human-Enhancement-Survey_0-01-150x150.png 150w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PS_2016.07.26_Human-Enhancement-Survey_0-01-300x300.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a></p>
<p>Neuralink co-founder Flip Sabes doesn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>To a scientist, to think about changing the fundamental nature of life—creating viruses, eugenics, etc.—it raises a specter that many biologists find quite worrisome, whereas the neuroscientists that I know, when they think about chips in the brain, it doesn’t seem that foreign, because we already have chips in the brain. We have deep brain stimulation to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, we have early trials of chips to restore vision, we have the cochlear implant—so to us it doesn’t seem like that big of a stretch to put devices into a brain to read information out and to read information back in.</em></p>
<p class="p1">And after learning all about chips in the brain, I agree—and when Americans eventually learn about it, I think they&#8217;ll change their minds.</p>
<p class="p1">History supports this prediction. People were super timid about Lasik eye surgery when it first became a thing—20 years ago, 20,000 people a year had the procedure done. Then everyone got used to it and now 2,000,000 people a year get laser eye surgery. Similar story with pacemakers. And defibrillators. And organ transplants—which people at first considered a freakish Frankenstein-esque concept. Brain implants will probably be the same story.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Our non-understanding of the brain</strong></span></p>
<p>You know, the whole &#8220;if understanding the brain is a mile, we&#8217;re currently three inches in&#8221; thing. Flip weighed in on this topic too:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>If it were a prerequisite to understand the brain in order to interact with the brain in a substantive way, we’d have trouble. But it’s possible to decode all of those things in the brain without truly understanding the dynamics of the computation in the brain. Being able to read it out is an engineering problem. Being able to understand its origin and the organization of the neurons in fine detail in a way that would satisfy a neuroscientist to the core—that&#8217;s a separate problem. And we don’t need to solve all of those scientific problems in order to make progress.</em></p>
<p class="p1">If we can just use engineering to get neurons to talk to computers, we&#8217;ll have done our job, and machine learning can do much of the rest. Which then, ironically, <em>will </em>teach us about the brain. As Flip points out:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The flip side of saying, “We don’t need to understand the brain to make engineering progress,” is that making engineering progress will almost certainly advance our scientific knowledge—kind of like the way Alpha Go ended up teaching the world&#8217;s best players better strategies for the game. Then this scientific progress can lead to more engineering progress. The engineering and the science are gonna ratchet each other up here.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Angry giants</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Tesla and SpaceX are both stepping on some very big toes (like the auto industry, the oil and gas industry, and the military-industrial complex). Big toes don&#8217;t like being stepped on, so they&#8217;ll usually do whatever they can to hinder the stepper&#8217;s progress. Luckily, Neuralink doesn&#8217;t really have this problem. There aren&#8217;t any massive industries that Neuralink is disrupting (at least not in the foreseeable future—an eventual neuro revolution would disrupt almost <em>every </em>industry).</p>
<p class="p1">Neuralink&#8217;s hurdles are technology hurdles—and there are many. But two challenges stand out as the largest—challenges that, if conquered, may be impactful enough to trigger all the other hurdles to fall and totally change the trajectory of our future.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>Major Hurdle 1: Bandwidth</strong></span></p>
<p>There have never been more than a couple hundred electrodes in a human brain at once. When it comes to vision, that equals a super low-res image. When it comes to motor, that limits the possibilities to simple commands with little control. When it comes to your thoughts, a few hundred electrodes won&#8217;t be enough to communicate more than the simplest spelled-out message.</p>
<p>We need higher bandwidth if this is gonna become a big thing. <em>Way</em> higher bandwidth.</p>
<p>The Neuralink team threw out the number &#8220;one million simultaneously recorded neurons&#8221; when talking about an interface that could really change the world. I&#8217;ve also heard 100,000 as a number that would allow for the creation of a wide range of incredibly useful BMIs with a variety of applications.</p>
<p>Early computers had a similar problem. Primitive transistors took up a lot of space and didn&#8217;t scale easily. Then in 1959 came the integrated circuit—the computer chip. Now there was a way to scale the number of transistors in a computer, and Moore&#8217;s Law—the concept that the number of transistors that can fit onto a computer chip doubles every 18 months—was born.</p>
<p>Until the 90s, electrodes for BMIs were all made by hand. Then we started figuring out how to manufacture those little 100-electrode <a href="https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/electrodex299.jpg?sw=280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multielectrode arrays</a> using conventional semiconductor technologies. Neuralink co-founder Ben Rapoport believes that &#8220;the move from hand manufacturing to Utah Array electrodes was the first hint that BMIs were entering a realm where Moore’s Law could become relevant.”</p>
<p>This is everything for the industry&#8217;s potential. Our maximum today is a couple hundred electrodes able to measure about 500 neurons at once—which is either super far from a million or really close, depending on the kind of growth pattern we&#8217;re in. If we add 500 more neurons to our maximum every 18 months, we&#8217;ll get to a million in the year 5017. If we <em>double </em>our total every 18 months, like we do with computer transistors, we&#8217;ll get to a million in the year 2034.</p>
<p>Currently, we seem to be somewhere in between. Ian Stevenson and Konrad Kording published a <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/abs/nn.2731.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper</a> that looked at the maximum number of neurons that could be simultaneously recorded at various points throughout the last 50 years (in <em>any </em>animal), and put the results on this graph:<a href="#footnote2-45-6120" id="note2-45-6120" rel="footnote2">45</a>

<p>Sometimes called Stevenson&#8217;s Law, this research suggests that the number of neurons we can simultaneously record seems to consistently double every 7.4 years. If that rate continues, it&#8217;ll take us till the end of this century to reach a million, and until 2225 to record every neuron in the brain and get our totally complete wizard hat.</p>
<p>Whatever the equivalent of the integrated circuit is for BMIs isn&#8217;t here yet, because 7.4 years is too big a number to start a revolution. The breakthrough here isn&#8217;t the device that can record a million neurons—it&#8217;s the paradigm shift that makes the future of that graph look more like Moore&#8217;s Law and less like Stevenson&#8217;s Law. Once that happens, a million neurons will follow.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>Major Hurdle 2: Implantation</strong></span></p>
<p>BMIs won&#8217;t sweep the world as long as you need to go in for skull-opening surgery to get involved.</p>
<p>This is a major topic at Neuralink. I think the word &#8220;non-invasive&#8221; or &#8220;non-invasively&#8221; came out of someone&#8217;s mouth like 42 times in my discussions with the team.</p>
<p>On top of being both a major barrier to entry and a major safety issue, invasive brain surgery is expensive and in limited supply. Elon talked about an eventual BMI implantation process that could be automated: &#8220;The machine to accomplish this would need to be something like Lasik, an automated process—because otherwise you just get constrained by the limited number of neural surgeons, and the costs are very high. You’d need a Lasik-like machine ultimately to be able to do this at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making BMIs high-bandwidth alone would be a huge deal, as would developing a way to non-invasively implant devices. But doing <em>both </em>would start a revolution.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Other hurdles</strong></span></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s BMI patients have a wire coming out of their head. In the future, that certainly won&#8217;t fly. Neuralink plans to work on devices that will be wireless. But that brings a lot of new challenges with it. You&#8217;ll now need your device to be able to send and receive a lot of data wirelessly. Which means the implant also has to take care of things like signal amplification, analog-to-digital conversion, and data compression on its own. Oh and it needs to be powered inductively.</p>
<p>Another big one—biocompatibility. Delicate electronics tend to not do well inside a jello ball. And the human body tends to not like having foreign objects in it. But the brain interfaces of the future are intended to last forever without any problems. This means that the device will likely need to be hermetically sealed and robust enough to survive decades of the oozing and shifting of the neurons around it. And the brain—which treats today&#8217;s devices like invaders and eventually covers them in scar tissue—will need to somehow be tricked into thinking the device is just a normal brain part doing its thing.<a href="#footnote-29-6120" id="note-29-6120" rel="footnote">29</a>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the space issue. Where exactly are you gonna put your device that can interface with a million neurons in a skull that&#8217;s already dealing with making space for 100 billion neurons? A million electrodes using today&#8217;s multielectrode arrays would be the size of a baseball. So further miniaturization is another dramatic innovation to add to the list.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the fact that today&#8217;s electrodes are mostly optimized for simple electrical recording or simple electrical stimulation. If we really want an effective brain interface, we&#8217;ll need something other than single-function, stiff electrodes—something with the mechanical complexity of neural circuits, that can both record and stimulate, and that can interact with neurons chemically and mechanically as well as electrically.</p>
<p>And just say all of this comes together perfectly—a high-bandwidth, long-lasting, biocompatible, bidirectional communicative, non-invasively-implanted device. Now we can speak back and forth with a million neurons at once! Except this little thing where we actually don&#8217;t know how to talk to neurons. It&#8217;s complicated enough to decode the static-like firings of 100 neurons, but all we&#8217;re really doing is learning what a set of specific firings corresponds to and matching them up to simple commands. That won&#8217;t work with millions of signals. It&#8217;s like how Google Translate essentially uses two dictionaries to swap words from one dictionary to another—which is very different than <em>understanding language. </em>We&#8217;ll need a pretty big leap in machine learning before a computer will be able to actually know a language, and we&#8217;ll need just as big a leap for machines to understand the language of the brain—because humans certainly won&#8217;t be learning to decipher the code of millions of simultaneously chattering neurons.</p>
<p>How easy does colonizing Mars seem right now.</p>
<p>But I bet the telephone and the car and the moon landing would have seemed like insurmountable technological challenges to people a few decades earlier. Just like I bet this—</p>

<p>—would have seemed utterly inconceivable to people at the time of this:</p>

<p>And yet, there it is in your pocket. If there&#8217;s one thing we should learn from the past, it&#8217;s that there will <em>always </em>be ubiquitous technology of the future that&#8217;s inconceivable to people of the past. We don&#8217;t know <em>which </em>technologies that seem positively impossible to us will turn out to be ubiquitous later in our lives—but there will be some. People always underestimate the Human Colossus.</p>
<p>If everyone you know in 40 years has electronics in their skull, it&#8217;ll be because a paradigm shift took place that caused a fundamental shift in this industry. That shift is what the Neuralink team will try to figure out. Other teams are working on it too, and some cool ideas are being developed:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Current BMI innovations</strong></span></p>

<p>Silk can be rolled up into a thin bundle and inserted into the brain relatively non-invasively. There, it would theoretically spread out around the brain and melt into the contours like shrink wrap. On the silk would be flexible silicon transistor arrays.</p>

<p>Other non-invasive techniques involve going in through veins and arteries. Elon mentioned this: &#8220;The least invasive way would be something that comes in like a hard stent like through a femoral artery and ultimately unfolds in the vascular system to interface with the neurons. Neurons use a lot of energy, so there’s basically a road network to every neuron.&#8221;</p>
<p>DARPA, the technology innovation arm of the US military,<a href="#footnote-30-6120" id="note-30-6120" rel="footnote">30</a> through their recently funded <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/program/our-research/darpa-and-the-brain-initiative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRAIN program</a>, is working on tiny, “closed-loop” neural implants that could replace medication.<a href="#footnote2-49-6120" id="note2-49-6120" rel="footnote2">49</a>

<p>A second DARPA project aims to fit a million electrodes into a device the size of two nickels stacked.</p>
<p>Another idea being worked on is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), in which a magnetic coil outside the head can create electrical pulses inside the brain.<a href="#footnote2-50-6120" id="note2-50-6120" rel="footnote2">50</a>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6187 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="324" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation.jpg 360w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation-300x270.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></p>
<p>The pulses can stimulate targeted neuron areas, providing a type of deep brain stimulation that’s totally non-invasive.</p>
<p>One of Neuralink&#8217;s co-founders, DJ Seo, led an effort to design an even cooler interface called &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neural dust</a>.&#8221; Neural dust refers to tiny, 100µm silicon sensors (about the same as the width of a hair) that would be sprinkled through the cortex. Right nearby, above the pia, would be a 3mm-sized device that could communicate with the dust sensors via ultrasound.</p>
<p>This is another example of the innovation benefits that come from an interdisciplinary team. DJ explained to me that &#8220;there are technologies that are not really thought about in this domain, but we can bring in some principles of their work.&#8221; He says that neural dust is inspired both by microchip technology and RFID (the thing that allows hotel key cards to communicate with the door lock without making physical contact) principles. And you can easily see the multi-field influence in how it works:<a href="#footnote2-51-6120" id="note2-51-6120" rel="footnote2">51</a>

<p>Others are working on even more out-there ideas, like <strong><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/optogenetics-controlling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optogenetics</a></strong> (where you inject a virus that attaches to a brain cell, causing it to thereafter be stimulated by light) or even using <strong><a href="http://news.rice.edu/2015/03/25/carbon-nanotube-fibers-make-superior-links-to-brain-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">carbon nanotubes</a></strong>—a million of which could be bundled together and sent to the brain via the bloodstream.</p>
<p>These people are all working on this arrow:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a relatively small group right now, but when the breakthrough spark happens, that&#8217;ll quickly change. Developments will begin to happen rapidly. Brain interface bandwidth will get better and better as the procedures to implant them become simpler and cheaper. Public interest will pick up. And when public interest picks up, the Human Colossus notices an opportunity—and then the rate of development skyrockets. Just like the breakthroughs in computer hardware caused the software industry to explode, major industries will pop up working on cutting-edge machines and intelligent apps to be used in conjunction with brain interfaces, and you&#8217;ll tell some little kid in 2052 all about how when you grew up, no one could do any of the things she can do with her brain, and she&#8217;ll be bored.</p>
<p>I tried to get the Neuralink team to talk about 2052 with me. I wanted to know what life was going to be like once this all became a thing. I wanted to know what went in the [Pilot ACE : iPhone 7 :: Early BMIs : ____] blank. But it wasn&#8217;t easy—this was a team built specifically because of their focus on concrete results, not hype, and I was doing the equivalent of talking to people in the late 1700s who were feverishly trying to create a breakthrough steam engine and prodding them about when they thought there would be airplanes.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d keep pulling teeth until they&#8217;d finally talk about their thoughts on the far future to get my hand off their tooth. I also focused a large portion of my talks with Elon on the far future possibilities and had other helpful discussions with Moran Cerf, a neuroscientist friend of mine who <a href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-if-we-could-look-inside-human-brains-moran-cerf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">works on BMIs</a> and thinks a lot about the long-term outlook. Finally, one reluctant-to-talk-about-his-predictions Neuralink team member told me that of course, he and his colleagues <em>were</em> dreamers—otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t be doing what they&#8217;re doing—and that many of them were inspired to get into this industry by science fiction. He recommended I talk to Ramez Naam, writer of the popular <a href="http://amzn.to/2pqeLNy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Nexus Trilogy</em></a>, a series all about the future of BMIs, and also someone with a hard tech background that includes 19 software-related patents. So I had a chat with Ramez to round out the picture and ask him the 435 remaining questions I had about everything.</p>
<p>And I came out of all of it utterly blown away. I wrote <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">once</a> about how I think if you went back to 1750—a time when there was no electricity or motorized vehicles or telecommunication—and retrieved, say, George Washington, and brought him to today and showed him our world, he&#8217;d be so shocked by everything that he&#8217;d die. You&#8217;d have killed George Washington and messed everything up. Which got me thinking about the concept of how many years one would need to go into the future such that the ensuing shock from the level of progress would kill you. I called it a Die Progress Unit, or DPU.</p>
<p>Ever since the Human Colossus was born, our world has had a weird property to it—it gets more <em>magical</em> as time goes on. That&#8217;s why DPUs are a thing. And because advancement begets more rapid advancement, the trend is that as time passes, the DPUs get <em>shorter</em>. For George Washington, a DPU was a couple hundred years, which is outrageously short in the scheme of human history. But we now live in a time where things are moving <em>so </em>fast that we might experience one or even multiple DPUs <em>in our lifetime</em>. The amount that changed between 1750 and 2017 might happen again between now and another time when you&#8217;re still alive. This is a <em>ridiculous</em> time to be alive—it&#8217;s just hard for us to notice because we live life so zoomed in.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think about DPUs a lot and I always wonder what it would feel like to go forward in a time machine and experience what George would experience coming here. What kind of future could blow my mind so hard that it would kill me? We can talk about things like AI and gene editing—and I have no doubt that progress in those areas could make me die of shock—but it&#8217;s always, &#8220;Who knows what it&#8217;ll be like!&#8221; Never a descriptive picture.</p>
<p><a name="part5"></a>I think I might finally have a descriptive picture of a piece of our shocking future. Let me paint it for you.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 28pt;"><strong>Part 5: The Wizard Era</strong></span></p>

<p>The budding industry of brain-machine interfaces is the seed of a revolution that will change just about everything. But in many ways, the brain-interface future isn&#8217;t really a new <em>thing</em> that&#8217;s happening. If you take a step back, it looks more like the next big chapter in a trend that&#8217;s been going on for a long time. Language took forever to turn into writing, which then took forever to turn into printing, and that&#8217;s where things were when George Washington was around. Then came electricity and the pace picked up. Telephone. Radio. Television. Computers. And just like that, everyone&#8217;s homes became magical. Then phones became cordless. Then mobile. Computers went from being devices for work and games to windows into a digital world we all became a part of. Then phones and computers merged into an everything device that brought the magic out of our homes and put it into our hands. And on our wrists. We&#8217;re now in the early stages of a virtual and augmented reality revolution that will wrap the magic around our eyes and ears and bring our whole being into the digital world.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to be a futurist to see where this is going.</p>
<p>Magic has worked its way from industrial facilities to our homes to our hands and soon it&#8217;ll be around our heads. And then it’ll take the next natural step. The magic is heading into our brains.</p>
<p>It will happen by way of a &#8220;whole-brain interface,” or what I&#8217;ve been calling a wizard hat—a brain interface so complete, so smooth, so biocompatible, and so high-bandwidth that it feels as much a part of you as your cortex and limbic system. A whole-brain interface would give your brain the ability to communicate wirelessly with the cloud, with computers, and with the brains of anyone with a similar interface in their head. This flow of information between your brain and the outside world would be so effortless, it would feel similar to the thinking that goes on in your head today. And though we’ve used the term brain-machine interface so far, I kind of think of a BMI as a specific brain interface to be used for a specific purpose, and the term doesn’t quite capture the everything-of-everything concept of the whole-brain interface. So I’ll call that a wizard hat instead.</p>
<p>Now, to fully absorb the implications of having a wizard hat installed in your head and what that would change about you, you&#8217;ll need to wrap your head around (no pun intended) two things:</p>
<p><strong>1) The intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) The super ridiculously intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p>
<p>We’ll tackle #1 in this section and save #2 for the last section after you’ve had time to absorb #1.</p>
<p>Elon calls the whole-brain interface and its many capabilities a &#8220;digital tertiary layer,” a term that has two levels of meaning that correspond to our two mind-bending ideas above.</p>
<p>The first meaning gets at the idea of physical brain parts. We discussed three layers of brain parts—the brain stem (run by the frog), the limbic system (run by the monkey), and the cortex (run by the rational thinker). We were being thorough, but for the rest of this post, we’re going to leave the frog out of the discussion, since he’s entirely functional and lives mostly behind the scenes.</p>
<p>When Elon refers to a “digital tertiary layer,” he’s considering our existing brain having two layers—our animal limbic system (which could be called our primary layer) and our advanced cortex (which could be called our secondary layer). The wizard hat interface, then, would be our tertiary layer—a new physical brain part to complement the other two.</p>
<p>If thinking about this concept is giving you the willies, Elon has news for you:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>We already have a digital tertiary layer in a sense, in that you have your computer or your phone or your applications. You can ask a question via Google and get an answer instantly. You can access any book or any music. With a spreadsheet, you can do incredible calculations. If you had an Empire State building filled with people—even if they had calculators, let alone if they had to do it with a pencil and paper—one person with a laptop could outdo the Empire State Building filled with people with calculators. You can video chat with someone in freaking Timbuktu for free. This would’ve gotten you burnt for witchcraft in the old days. You can record as much video with sound as you want, take a zillion pictures, have them tagged with who they are and when it took place. You can broadcast communications through social media to millions of people simultaneously for free. These are incredible superpowers that the President of the United States didn’t have twenty years ago.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>The thing that people, I think, don’t appreciate right now is that they are already a cyborg. You’re already a different creature than you would have been twenty years ago, or even ten years ago. You’re already a different creature. You can see this when they do surveys of like, “how long do you want to be away from your phone?” and—particularly if you’re a teenager or in your 20s—even a day hurts. If you leave your phone behind, it’s like missing limb syndrome. I think people—they’re already kind of merged with their phone and their laptop and their applications and everything.</em></p>
<p>This is a hard point to really absorb, because we don&#8217;t <em>feel </em>like cyborgs. We feel like humans who use devices to do things. But think about your digital self—you when you&#8217;re interacting with someone on the internet or over FaceTime or when you’re in a YouTube video. Digital you is fully you—as much as in-person you is you—right? The only difference is that you&#8217;re not there in person—you&#8217;re using magic powers to send yourself to somewhere far away, at light speed, through wires and satellites and electromagnetic waves. The difference is the medium.</p>
<p>Before language, there wasn&#8217;t a good way to get a thought from your brain into my brain. Then early humans invented the technology of language, transforming vocal cords and ears into the world&#8217;s first communication devices and air as the first communication medium. We use these devices every time we talk to each other in person. It goes:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-6307 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1.png" alt="" width="617" height="104" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1.png 617w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1-300x51.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1-600x101.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px" /></a></p>
<p>Then we built upon that with another leap, inventing a second layer of devices, with its own medium, allowing us to talk long distance:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6308" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2.png" alt="" width="900" height="69" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2.png 1322w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2-300x23.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2-768x59.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2-600x46.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Or maybe:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6309" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3.png" alt="" width="850" height="66" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3.png 1242w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3-300x23.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3-768x60.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3-600x47.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p>In that sense, your phone is as much &#8220;you&#8221; as your vocal cords or your ears or your eyes. All of these things are simply tools to move thoughts from brain to brain—so who cares if the tool is held in your hand, your throat, or your eye sockets? The digital age has made us a dual entity—a physical creature who interacts with its physical environment using its biological parts and a digital creature whose digital devices—whose digital <em>parts</em>—allow it to interact with the digital world.</p>
<p>But because we don&#8217;t think of it like that, we&#8217;d consider someone with a phone in their head or throat a cyborg and someone else with a phone in their hand, pressed up against their head, not a cyborg. Elon&#8217;s point is that the thing that makes a cyborg a cyborg is their capabilities—not from which side of the skull those capabilities are generated.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already a cyborg, we already have superpowers, and we already spend a huge part of our lives in the digital world. And when you think of it like that, you realize how obvious it is to want to upgrade the medium that connects us to that world. This is the change Elon believes is actually happening when the magic goes into our brains:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>You’re already digitally superhuman. The thing that would change is the interface—having a high-bandwidth interface to your digital enhancements. The thing is that today, the interface all necks down to this tiny straw, which is, particularly in terms of output, it’s like poking things with your meat sticks, or using words—either speaking or tapping things with fingers. And in fact, output has gone backwards. It used to be, in your most frequent form, output would be ten-finger typing. Now, it’s like, two-thumb typing. </em><em>That’s crazy slow communication. We should be able to improve that by many orders of magnitude with a direct neural interface.</em></p>
<p class="p1">In other words, putting our technology into our brains isn&#8217;t about whether it&#8217;s good or bad to become cyborgs. It&#8217;s that we <em>are </em>cyborgs and we will <em>continue </em>to be cyborgs—so it probably makes sense to upgrade ourselves from primitive, low-bandwidth cyborgs to modern, high-bandwidth cyborgs.</p>
<p class="p1">A whole-brain interface is that upgrade. It changes us from creatures whose primary and secondary layers live inside their heads and whose tertiary layer lives in their pocket, in their hand, or on their desk—</p>

<p>Your life is full of devices, including the one you’re currently using to read this. A wizard hat makes your <em>brain </em>into the device, allowing your thoughts to go straight from your head into the digital world.</p>

<p class="p1">Elon always emphasizes bandwidth when he talks about Neuralink’s wizard hat goals. Interface bandwidth allows incoming images to be HD, incoming sound to be hi-fi, and motor movement commands to be tightly controlled—but it&#8217;s also a huge factor in communication. If information were a milkshake, bandwidth would be the width of the straw. Today, the bandwidth-of-communication graph looks something like this:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6312" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="523" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-1.png 1548w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-1-300x224.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-1-768x574.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-1-600x448.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></strong></p>
<p class="p1">So computers can suck up the milkshake through a giant pipe, a human thinking would be using a large, pleasant-to-use straw, while language would be a frustratingly tiny coffee stirrer straw and typing (let alone texting) would be like trying to drink a milkshake through a syringe needle—you might be able to get a drop out once a minute.</p>
<p class="p1">Moran Cerf has gathered data on the actual bandwidth of different parts of the nervous system and on this graph, he compares them to equivalent bandwidths in the computer world:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html/bandwidth-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6499" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bandwidth-v2.png" alt="" width="800" height="556" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bandwidth-v2.png 1457w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bandwidth-v2-300x208.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bandwidth-v2-768x533.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bandwidth-v2-600x417.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You can see here on Moran’s graph that the disparity in bandwidth between the ways we communicate and our thinking (which is at 30 bits/second on this graph) is even starker than my graph above depicts.</p>
<p class="p1">But making our brains the device cuts out those tiny straws, turning all of these:</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6313" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-2.png" alt="" width="700" height="523" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-2.png 1548w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-2-300x224.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-2-768x574.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-2-600x448.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We’d still be using straws, but <em>far </em>bigger, more effective ones.</p>
<p class="p1">But it&#8217;s not just about the speed of communication. As Elon points out, it&#8217;s about the <em>nuance </em>and <em>accuracy</em> of communication as well:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>There are a bunch of concepts in your head that then your brain has to try to compress into this incredibly low data rate called speech or typing. That’s what language is—your brain has executed a compression algorithm on thought, on concept transfer. And then it’s got to listen as well, and decompress what’s coming at it. And this is very lossy as well. So, then when you’re doing the decompression on those, trying to understand, you’re simultaneously trying to model the other person’s mind state to understand where they’re coming from, to recombine in your head what concepts they have in their head that they’re trying to communicate to you. &#8230; If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person.</em></p>
<p class="p1">This makes sense—nuance is like a <em>high-resolution thought</em>, which makes the file simply too big to transfer quickly through a coffee straw. The coffee straw gives you two bad options when it comes to nuance: take a <em>lot </em>of time saying a lot of words to really depict the nuanced thought or imagery you want to convey to me, or save time by using succinct language—but inevitably fail to transfer over the nuance. Compounding the effect is the fact that language itself is a low-resolution medium. A word is simply an <em>approximation</em> of a thought—buckets that a whole category of similar-but-distinct thoughts can all be shoved into. If I watch a horror movie and want to describe it to you in words, I’m stuck with a few simple low-res buckets—“scary” or “creepy” or “chilling” or “intense.” My actual impression of that movie is very specific and not exactly like any other movie I’ve seen—but the crude tools of language force my brain to “round to the nearest bucket&#8221; and choose the word that most closely resembles my actual impression, and that’s the information you’ll receive from me. You won’t receive the thought—you’ll receive the <em>bucket</em>—and now you’ll have to guess which of the <em>many </em>nuanced impressions that all approximate to that bucket is the most similar to my impression of the movie. You’ll decompress my description—“scary as shit”—into a high-res, nuanced thought that <em>you </em>associate with “scary as shit,” which will inevitably be based on your own experience watching other horror movies, and your own personality. The end result is that a lot has been lost in translation—which is exactly what you’d expect when you try to transfer a high-res file over a low-bandwidth medium, quickly, using low-res tools. That’s why Elon calls language data transfer “lossy.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">We do the best we can with these limitations—and over time, we’ve supplemented language with slightly higher-resolution formats like video to better convey nuanced imagery, or music to better convey nuanced emotion. But compared to the richness and uniqueness of the ideas in our heads, and the large-bandwidth straw our internal <em>thoughts</em> flow through, all human-to-human communication is very lossy.</p>
<p class="p1">Thinking about the phenomenon of communication as what it is—brains trying to share things with each other—you see the history of communication not as this:</p>

<p class="p1">As much as this:</p>

<p class="p1">It really may be that the second major era of communication—the 100,000-year Era of Indirect Communication—is in its very last moments. If we zoom out on the timeline, it’s possible the entire last 150 years, during which we’ve suddenly been <em>rapidly </em>improving our communication media, will look to far-future humans like one concept: the transition from Era 2 to Era 3. We might be living <em>on </em>the line that divides timeline sections.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6464" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline.png" alt="" width="748" height="273" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline.png 1545w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline-300x109.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline-768x280.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline-600x219.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And because indirect communication requires third-party body parts or digital parts, the end of Era 2 may be looked back upon as the era of physical devices. In an era where your brain is the device, there will be no need to carry anything around. You&#8217;ll have your body and, if you want, clothes—and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p class="p1">When Elon thinks about wizard hats, this is usually the stuff he’s thinking about—communication bandwidth and resolution. And we’ll explore why in Part 6 of this post.</p>
<p class="p1">First, let’s dig into the mind-boggling concept of your brain becoming a device and talk about what a wizard hat world might be like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p class="p1">One thing to keep in mind as we think about all of this is that none of it will take you by surprise. You won&#8217;t go from having nothing in your brain to a digital tertiary layer in your head, just like people didn&#8217;t go from the Apple IIGS to using Tinder overnight. The Wizard Era will come gradually, and by the time the shift actually begins to happen, we’ll all be very used to the technology, and it&#8217;ll seem normal.</p>
<p class="p1">Supporting this point is the fact the staircase up to the Wizard Era has already started, and you haven&#8217;t even noticed. But there are thousands of people currently walking around with electrodes in their brain, like those with cochlear implants, retinal implants, and deep brain implants—all benefiting from early BMIs.</p>
<p class="p1">The next few steps on the staircase will continue to focus on restoring lost function in different parts of the body—the first people to have their lives transformed by digital brain technology will be the disabled. As specialized BMIs serve more and more forms of disability, the concept of brain implants will work its way in from the fringes and become something we&#8217;re all used to—just like no one blinks an eye when you say your friend just got Lasik surgery or your grandmother just got a pacemaker installed.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon talks about some types of people early BMIs could help:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The first use of the technology will be to repair brain injuries as a result of stroke or cutting out a cancer lesion, where somebody’s fundamentally lost a certain cognitive element. It could help with people who are quadriplegics or paraplegics by providing a neural shunt from the motor cortex down to where the muscles are activated. It can help with people who, as they get older, have memory problems and can’t remember the names of their kids, through memory enhancement, which could allow them to function well to a much later time in life—the medically advantageous elements of this for dealing with mental disablement of one kind or another, which of course happens to all of us when we get old enough, are very significant.</em></p>
<p class="p1">As someone who lost a grandfather to dementia five years before losing him to death, I’m excited to hear this.</p>
<p class="p1">And as interface bandwidth improves, disabilities that hinder millions today will start to drop like flies. The concepts of complete blindness and deafness—whether centered in the sensory organs or in the brain<a href="#footnote-31-6120" id="note-31-6120" rel="footnote">31</a>—are already on the way out. And with enough time, perfect vision or hearing will be restorable.</p>
<p class="p1">Prosthetic limbs—and eventually sleek, full-body exoskeletons underneath your clothes—will work so well, providing both outgoing motor functions and an incoming sense of touch, that paralysis or amputations will only have a minor long-term effect on people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p class="p1">In Alzheimer&#8217;s patients, memories themselves are often not lost—only the bridge to those memories. Advanced BMIs could help restore that bridge or serve as a new one.</p>
<p class="p1">While this is happening, BMIs will begin to emerge that people <em>without</em> disabilities want. The very early adopters will probably be pretty rich. But so were the early cell phone adopters.<a href="#footnote2-52-6120" id="note2-52-6120" rel="footnote2">52</a>

<p class="p1">That&#8217;s Gordon Gekko, and that 1983, two-pound cell phone cost almost <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2010/09/23/gordon_gekko_s_cell_phone.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$9,000</a> in today&#8217;s dollars. And now over half of living humans own a mobile phone—all of them far less shitty than Gordon Gekko&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="p1">As mobile phones got cheaper, and better, they went from new and fancy and futuristic to ubiquitous. As we go down the same road with brain interfaces, things are going to get <em>really </em>cool.</p>
<p class="p1">Based on what I learned from my conversations with Elon, Ramez, and a dozen neuroscientists, let&#8217;s look at what the world might look like in a few decades. The timeline is uncertain, including the order in which the below developments may become a reality. And, of course, some of the below predictions are sure to be way off the mark, just as there will be other developments in this field that won’t be mentioned here because people today literally can’t imagine them yet.</p>
<p class="p1">But some version of a lot of this stuff probably<em> will</em> happen, at <em>some </em>point, and a lot of it could be in your lifetime.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking at all the predictions I heard, they seemed to fall into two broad categories: communication capabilities and internal enhancements.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>The Wizard Era: Communication</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6473" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading.png" alt="" width="400" height="439" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading.png 818w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading-273x300.png 273w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading-768x843.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading-547x600.png 547w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Motor communication</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">“Communication” in this section can mean human-to-human or human-to-computer. Motor communication is all about human-to-computer—the whole &#8220;motor cortex as remote control&#8221; thing from earlier, but now the unbelievably rad version.</p>
<p class="p1">Like many future categories of brain interface possibility, motor communication will start with restoration applications for the disabled, and as those development efforts continually advance the possibilities, the technology will begin to be used to create <em>augmentation </em>applications for the non-disabled as well. The same technologies that will allow a quadriplegic to use their thoughts as a remote control to move a bionic limb can let anyone use their thoughts as a remote control&#8230;to move anything. Well not <em>anything—</em>I&#8217;m not talking about telekinesis—anything built to be used with a brain remote. But in the Wizard Era, <em>lots </em>of things will be built that way.</p>
<p class="p1">Your car (or whatever people use for transportation at that point) will pull up to your house and your mind will open the car door. You&#8217;ll walk up to the house and your mind will unlock and open the front door (all doors at that point will be built with sensors to receive motor cortex commands). You&#8217;ll think about wanting coffee and the coffee maker will get that going. As you head to the fridge the door will open and after getting what you need it&#8217;ll close as you walk away. When it&#8217;s time for bed, you&#8217;ll decide you want the heat turned down and the lights turned off, and those systems will feel you make that decision and adjust themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">None of this stuff will take any effort or thought—we&#8217;ll all get very good at it and it&#8217;ll feel as automatic and subconscious as moving your eyes to read this sentence does to you now.</p>
<p class="p1">People will play the piano with their thoughts. And do building construction. And steer vehicles. In fact, today, if you&#8217;re driving somewhere and something jumps out in the road in front of you, what neuroscientists know is that your brain sees it and begins to react well before your consciousness knows what&#8217;s going on or your arms move to steer out of the way. But when your brain is the one steering the car, you&#8217;ll have swerved out of the way before you even realize what happened.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Thought communication</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">This is what we discussed up above—but you have to resist the natural instinct to equate a thought conversation with a normal language conversation where you simply hear each other&#8217;s voices in your head. As we discussed, words are compressed approximations of uncompressed thoughts, so why would you ever bother with any of that, or deal with lossiness, if you didn’t have to? When you watch a movie, your head is buzzing with thoughts—but do you have a compressed spoken word dialogue going on in your head? Probably not—you&#8217;re just <em>thinking</em>. Thought conversations will be like <em>that</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon says:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>If I were to communicate a concept to you, you would essentially engage in consensual telepathy. You wouldn’t need to verbalize unless you want to add a little flair to the conversation or something (laughs), but the conversation would be conceptual interaction on a level that’s difficult to conceive of right now.</em></p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s the thing—it&#8217;s difficult to really understand what it would be like to <em>think </em>with someone. We&#8217;ve never been able to try. We communicate with ourselves through thought and with everyone else through symbolic representations of thought, and that’s all we can imagine.</p>
<p class="p1">Even weirder is the concept of a <em>group </em>thinking together. This is what a group brainstorm could look like in the Wizard Era.</p>

<p class="p1">And of course, they wouldn&#8217;t need to be in the same room. This group could have been in four different countries while this was happening—with no external devices in sight.</p>
<p class="p1">Ramez has <a href="http://rameznaam.com/2015/05/15/the-ultimate-interface-your-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written about</a> the effect group thinking might have on the world:</p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">That type of communication would have a huge impact on the pace of innovation, as scientists and engineers could work more fluidly together. And it’s just as likely to have a transformative effect on the public sphere, in the same way that email, blogs, and Twitter have successively changed public discourse.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">The idea of collaboration today is <em>supposed </em>to be two or more brains working together to come up with things none of them could have on their own. And a lot of the time, it works pretty well—but when you consider the “lost in transmission” phenomenon that happens with language, you realize how much more effective group thinking would be.</p>
<p class="p1">I asked Elon a question that pops into everyone’s mind when they first hear about thought communication:</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;So, um, will everyone be able to know what I&#8217;m thinking?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">He assured me they would not. &#8220;People won&#8217;t be able to read your thoughts—you would have to will it. If you don’t will it, it doesn’t happen. Just like if you don’t will your mouth to talk, it doesn’t talk.” Phew.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also think with a computer. Not just to issue a command, but to actually brainstorm something with a computer. You and a computer could strategize something together. You could compose a piece of music together. Ramez talked about using a computer as an imagination collaborator: &#8220;You could imagine something, and the computer, which can better forward predict or analyze physical models, could fill in constraints—and that allows you to get feedback.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">One concern that comes up when people hear about thought communication in particular is a potential loss of individuality. Would this make us one great hive mind with each individual brain as just another bee? Almost across the board, the experts I talked to believed it would be the opposite. We could act as one in a collaboration when it served us, but technology has thus far enhanced human individuality. Think of how much easier it is for people today to express their individuality and customize life to themselves than it was 50 or 100 or 500 years ago. There&#8217;s no reason to believe that trend won&#8217;t continue with more progress.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Multimedia communication</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Similar to thought communication, but imagine how much easier it would be to describe a dream you had or a piece of music stuck in your head or a memory you&#8217;re thinking about if you could just beam the thing into someone&#8217;s head, like showing them on your computer screen. Or as Elon said, &#8220;I could think of a bouquet of flowers and have a very clear picture in my head of what that is. It would take a lot of words for you to even have an approximation of what that bouquet of flowers looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">How much faster could a team of engineers or architects or designers plan out a new bridge or a new building or a new dress if they could beam the vision in their head onto a screen and others could adjust it with their minds, versus sketching things out—which not only takes far longer, but probably is inevitably lossy?</p>
<p class="p1">How many symphonies could Mozart have written if he had been able to think the music in his head onto the page? How many Mozarts are out there right now who never learned how to play instruments well enough to get their talent out?</p>
<p class="p1">I watched this <em>delightful</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_MSFkZHNi4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animated short movie</a> the other day, and below the video the creator, Felix Colgrave, said the video took him two years. How much of that time was spent dreaming up the art versus painstakingly getting it from his head into the software? Maybe in a few decades, I&#8217;ll be able to watch animation streaming live out of Felix&#8217;s head.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Emotional communication</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Emotions are the quintessential example of a concept that words are poorly-equipped to accurately describe. If ten people say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sad,&#8221; it actually means ten different things. In the Wizard Era, we&#8217;ll probably learn pretty quickly that the specific emotions people feel are as unique to people as their appearance or sense of humor.</p>
<p class="p1">This could work as communication—when one person communicates just what they&#8217;re feeling, the other person would be able to access the feeling in their own emotional centers. Obvious implications for a future of heightened empathy. But emotional communication could also be used for things like entertainment, where a movie, say, could also project out to the audience—directly into their limbic systems—certain feelings it wants the audience to feel as they watch. This is already what the film score does—another hack—and now it could be done directly.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Sensory communication</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">This one is intense.</p>
<p class="p1">Right now, the only two microphones that can act as inputs for the &#8220;speaker&#8221; in your head—your auditory cortex—are your two ears. The only two cameras that can be hooked up to the projector in your head—your visual cortex—are your two eyes. The only sensory surface that you can feel is your skin. The only thing that lets you experience taste is your tongue.</p>
<p class="p1">But in the same way we can currently hook an implant, for example, into someone&#8217;s cochlea—which connects a <em>different </em>mic to their auditory cortex—down the road we&#8217;ll be able to let sensory input information stream into your wizard hat wirelessly, from anywhere, and channel right into your sensory cortices the same way your bodily sensory organs do today. In the future, sensory organs will be only one set of inputs into your senses—and compared to what our senses will have access to, not a very exciting one.</p>
<p class="p1">Now what about output?</p>
<p class="p1">Currently, the only speaker your ear inputs can play <em>out</em> of is your auditory cortex. Only <em>you</em> can see what your eye cameras capture and only you can feel what touches your skin—because only you have access to the particular cortices those inputs are wired to. With a wizard hat, it would be a breeze for your brain to beam those input signals out of your head.</p>
<p class="p1">So you&#8217;ll have sensory input capabilities and sensory output capabilities—or both at the same time. This will open up all <em>kinds </em>of amazing possibilities.</p>
<p class="p1">Say you&#8217;re on a beautiful hike and you want to show your husband the view. No problem—just think out to him to request a brain connection. When he accepts, connect your retina feed to his visual cortex. Now his vision is filled with exactly what your eyes see, as if he&#8217;s there. He asks for the other senses to get the full picture, so you connect those too and now he hears the waterfall in the distance and feels the breeze and smells the trees and jumps when a bug lands on your arm. You two share the equivalent of a five-minute discussion about the scene—your favorite parts, which other places it reminds you of, etc. along with a shared story from his day—in a 30-second thought session. He says he has to get back to what he was working on, so he cuts off the sense connections except for vision, which he reduces to a little picture-in-picture window on the side of his visual field so he can check out more of the hike from time to time.</p>
<p class="p1">A surgeon could control a machine scalpel with her motor cortex instead of holding one in her hand, and she could receive sensory input from that scalpel so that it would feel like an 11th finger to her. So it would be as if one of her fingers <em>was </em>a scalpel and she could do the surgery without holding any tools, giving her much finer control over her incisions. An inexperienced surgeon performing a tough operation could bring a couple of her mentors into the scene as she operates to watch her work through her eyes and think instructions or advice to her. And if something goes really wrong, one of them could &#8220;take the wheel&#8221; and connect their motor cortex to her outputs to take control of her hands.</p>
<p class="p1">There would be no more need for screens of course—because you could just make a virtual screen appear in your visual cortex. Or jump into a VR movie with all your senses. Speaking of VR—Facebook, the maker of the Oculus Rift, is diving into this too. In an interview with Mark Zuckerberg about VR (for an upcoming post), the conversation at one point turned to BMIs. He said: &#8220;Touch gives you input and it’s a little bit of haptic feedback.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Over the long term, it’s not clear that we won’t just like to have our hands in no controller, and maybe, instead of having buttons that we press, we would just <em>think</em> something.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The ability to record sensory input means you can also record your memories, or share them—since a memory in the first place is just a not-so-accurate playback of previous sensory input. Or you could play them back as live experiences. In other words, that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw3GIR70HAY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Mirror episode</a> will probably actually happen.</p>
<p class="p1">An NBA player could send out a livestream invitation to his fans before a game, which would let them see and hear through his eyes and ears while he plays. Those who miss it could jump into the recording later.</p>
<p class="p1">You could save a great sex experience in the cloud to enjoy again later—or, if you&#8217;re not too private a person, you could send it over to a friend to experience. (Needless to say, the porn industry will thrive in the digital brain world.)</p>
<p class="p1">Right now, you can go on YouTube and watch a first-hand account of almost anything, for free. This would have blown George Washington&#8217;s mind—but in the Wizard Era, you&#8217;ll be able to actually<em> experience</em> almost anything for free. The days of fancy experiences being limited to rich people will be long over.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another idea, via the imagination of Moran Cerf: Maybe player brain injuries will drive the NFL to alter the rules so that the players&#8217; biological bodies stay on the sidelines, while they play the game with an artificial body whose motor cortex they control and whose eyes and ears they see and hear through. I like this idea and think it would be closer to the current NFL than it seems at first. In one way, you&#8217;ll still need to be a great athlete to play, since most of what makes a great athlete great is their motor cortex, their muscle memory, and their decision-making. But the other component of being a great athlete—the physical body itself—would now be artificial. The NFL could make all of the artificial playing bodies identical—this would be a cool way to see whose skills were actually best—or they could insist that artificial body matches in every way the biological body of the athlete, to mimic as closely as possible how the game would go if players used their biological bodies like in the old days. Either way, if this rule change happened, you can imagine how <em>crazy</em> it would seem to people that players used to have their actual, fragile brains <em>on the field</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1">I could go on. The communication possibilities in a wizard hat world, especially when you combine them with each other, are endless—and damn fun to think about.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>The Wizard Era: Internal Control</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6441" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading.png" alt="" width="250" height="453" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading.png 523w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading-166x300.png 166w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading-331x600.png 331w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Communication—the flow of information into and out of your brain—is only one way your wizard hat will be able to serve you.</p>
<p class="p1">A whole-brain interface can stimulate any part of your brain in any way—it has to have this capability for the input half of all the communication examples above. But that capability also gives you a whole new level of control over your brain. Here are some ways people of the future might take advantage of that:</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Win the battle in your head for both sides</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Often, the battle in our heads between our prefrontal cortex and limbic system comes down to the fact that both parties are trying to do what&#8217;s best for us—it’s just that our limbic system is wrong about what&#8217;s best for us because it thinks we live in a tribe 50,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="p1">Your limbic system isn&#8217;t making you eat your ninth Starburst candy in a row because it&#8217;s a dick—it&#8217;s making you eat it because it thinks that A) any fruit that sweet and densely chewy must be <em>super </em>rich in calories and B) you might not find food again for the next four days so it’s a good idea to load up on a high-calorie food whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
<p class="p1">Meanwhile, your prefrontal cortex is just watching in horror like &#8220;WHY ARE WE DOING THIS.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">But Moran believes that a good brain interface could fix this problem:<a href="#footnote2-53-6120" id="note2-53-6120" rel="footnote2">53</a>
<p class="p1"><em>Consider eating a chocolate cake. While eating, we feed data to our cognitive apparatus. These data provide the enjoyment of the cake. The enjoyment isn’t in the cake, per se, but in our neural experience of it. Decoupling our sensory desire (the experience of cake) from the underlying survival purpose (nutrition) will soon be within our reach.</em></p>
<p class="p1">This concept of &#8220;sensory decoupling&#8221; would make <em>so </em>much sense if we could pull it off. You could get the <em>enjoyment </em>of eating like shit without actually putting shit in your body. Instead, Moran says, what would go in your body would be &#8220;nutrition inputs customized for each person based on genomes, microbiomes or other factors. Physical diets released from the tyranny of desire.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-54-6120" id="note2-54-6120" rel="footnote2">54</a>
<p class="p1">The same principle could apply to things like sex, drugs, alcohol, and other pleasures that get people into trouble, healthwise or otherwise.</p>
<p class="p1">Ramez Naam talks about how a brain interface could also help us win the discipline battle when it comes to time:<a href="#footnote2-55-6120" id="note2-55-6120" rel="footnote2">55</a>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">We know that stimulating the right centers in the brain can induce sleep or alertness, hunger or satiation, ease or stimulation, as quick as the flip of a switch. Or, if you’re running code, on a schedule. (Siri: Put me to sleep until 7:30, high priority interruptions only. And let’s get hungry for lunch around noon. Turn down the sugar cravings, though.)</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Take control of mood disorders</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Ramez also emphasized that a great deal of scientific evidence suggests that moods and disorders are tied to what the chemicals in your brain are doing. Right now, we take drugs to alter those chemicals, and Ramez explains why direct neural stimulation is a far better option:<a href="#footnote2-56-6120" id="note2-56-6120" rel="footnote2">56</a>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Pharmaceuticals enter the brain and then spread out randomly, hitting whatever receptor they work on all across your brain. Neural interfaces, by contrast, can stimulate just one area at a time, can be tuned in real-time, and can carry information out about what’s happening.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">Depression, anxiety, OCD, and other disorders may be easy to eradicate once we can take better control of what goes on in our brain.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Mess with your senses</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Want to hear what a dog hears? That&#8217;s easy. The pitch range we can hear is limited by the dimensions of our cochlea—but pitches out of the ear’s range can be sent straight into our auditory nerve.<a href="#footnote-32-6120" id="note-32-6120" rel="footnote">32</a>
<p class="p1">Or maybe you want a new sense. You love bird watching and want to be able to sense when there&#8217;s a bird nearby. So you buy an infrared camera that can detect bird locations by their heat signals and you link it to your brain interface, which stimulates neurons in a certain way to alert you to the presence of a bird and tell you its location. I can&#8217;t describe what you&#8217;d experience when it alerts you, so I&#8217;ll just say words like &#8220;feel&#8221; or &#8220;see,&#8221; because I can only imagine the five senses we have. But in the future, there will be more words for new, useful types of senses.</p>
<p class="p1">You could also dim or shut off parts of a sense, like pain perhaps. Pain is the body&#8217;s way of telling us we need to address something, but in the future, we&#8217;ll elect to get that information in much less unpleasant formats.<a href="#footnote-33-6120" id="note-33-6120" rel="footnote">33</a>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Increase your knowledge </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">There&#8217;s evidence from experiments with rats that it&#8217;s possible to boost how fast a brain can learn—sometimes by 2x or even 3x—just by priming certain neurons to prepare to make a long-term connection.</p>
<p class="p1">Your brain would also have access to all the knowledge in the world, at all times. I talked to Ramez about how accessing information in the cloud might work. We parsed it out into four layers of capability, each requiring a more advanced brain interface than the last:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Level 1:</strong> I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info—like Googling something with my brain—and the answer, in text, appears in my mind&#8217;s eye. Basically what I do now except it all happens in my head.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Level 2: </strong>I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info, and then a second later I just <em>know </em>it. No reading was involved—it was more like the way I&#8217;d recall something from memory.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Level 3: </strong>I just know the fact I want to know the second I want it. I don&#8217;t even know if it came from the cloud or if it was stored in my brain. I can essentially treat the whole cloud like my brain. I don&#8217;t know all the info—my brain could never fit it all—but any time I want to know something it downloads into my consciousness so seamlessly and quickly, it&#8217;s as if it were there all along.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Level 4: </strong>Beyond just knowing facts, I can deeply <em>understand</em> anything I want to, in a complex way. We discussed the example of <em>Moby Dick</em>. Could I download <em>Moby Dick</em> from the cloud into my memory and then suddenly have it be the same as if I had read the whole book? Where I&#8217;d have thoughts and opinions and I could cite passages and have discussions about the themes?</p>
<p class="p1">Ramez thinks all four of these are possible with enough time, but that the fourth in particular will take a very long time to happen, if ever.</p>
<p class="p1">So there are about 50 delightful potential things about putting a wizard hat on your brain. Now for the undelightful part.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The scary thing about wizard hats</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">As is always the case with the advent of new technologies, when the Wizard Era rolls around, the dicks of the world will do their best to ruin everything.</p>
<p class="p1">And this time, the stakes are extra high. Here are some things that could suck:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Trolls can have an even fielder day. </strong>The troll-type personalities of the world have been having a field day ever since the internet came out. They literally can&#8217;t believe their luck. But with brain interfaces, they&#8217;ll have an even fielder day. Being more connected to each other means a lot of good things—like empathy going up as a result of more exposure to all kinds of people—but it also means a lot of bad things. Just like the internet. Bad guys will have more opportunity to spread hate or build hateful coalitions. The internet has been a godsend for ISIS, and a brain-connected world would be an even more helpful recruiting tool.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Computers crash. </strong>And they have bugs. And normally that&#8217;s not the end of the world, because you can try restarting, and if it&#8217;s really being a piece of shit, you can just get a new computer. You can&#8217;t get a new head. There will have to be a way <em>way </em>higher number of precautions taken here.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Computers can be hacked. </strong>Except this time they have access to your thoughts, sensory input, and memories. Bad times.</p>
<p><strong>Holy shit computers can be hacked. </strong>In the last item I was thinking about bad guys using hacking to <em>steal</em> information from my brain. But brain interfaces <em>can also put information in. </em>Meaning a clever hacker might be able to change your thoughts or your vote or your identity or make you want to do something terrible you normally wouldn&#8217;t ever consider. And you wouldn&#8217;t know it ever happened. You could feel strongly about voting for a candidate and a little part of you would wonder if someone manipulated your thoughts so you&#8217;d feel that way. The darkest possible scenario would be an ISIS-type organization actually influencing millions of people to join their cause by altering their thoughts. This is definitely the scariest paragraph in this post. Let&#8217;s get out of here.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Why the Wizard Era will be a good thing anyway even though there are a lot of dicks</strong></span></p>
<p>Physics advancements allow bad guys to make nuclear bombs. Biological advancements allow bad guys to make bioweapons. The invention of cars and planes led to crashes that kill over a million people a year. The internet enabled the spread of fake news, made us vulnerable to cyberattack, made terrorist recruiting efforts easier, and allowed predators to flourish.</p>
<p>And yet—</p>
<p>Would people choose to reverse our understanding of science, go back to the days of riding horses across land and boats across the ocean, or get rid of the internet?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>New technology also comes along with real dangers and it always <em>does </em>end up harming a lot of people. But it also always seems to help a lot <em>more </em>people than it harms. Advancing technology almost always proves to be a net positive.</p>
<p>People also love to hate the <em>concept</em> of new technology—because they worry it&#8217;s unhealthy and makes us less human. But those same people, if given the option, usually wouldn’t consider going back to George Washington&#8217;s time, when half of children died before the age of 5, when traveling to other parts of the world was impossible for almost everyone, when a far greater number of humanitarian atrocities were being committed than there are today, when women and ethnic minorities had <em>far </em>fewer rights across the world than they do today, when far more people were illiterate and far more people were living under the poverty line than there are today. They wouldn&#8217;t go back 250 years—a time right before <em>the biggest explosion of technology in human history</em> <em>happened.</em> Sounds like people who are immensely <em>grateful </em>for technology. And yet their opinion holds—our technology is ruining our lives, people in the old days were much wiser, our world&#8217;s going to shit, etc. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve thought about it hard enough.</p>
<p>So when it comes to what will be a long list of dangers of the Wizard Era—they suck, and they&#8217;ll continue to suck as some of them play out into sickening atrocities and catastrophes. But a vastly larger group of good guys will wage war back, as they always do, and a giant &#8220;brain security&#8221; industry will be born. And I bet, if given the option, people in the Wizard Era wouldn&#8217;t for a second consider coming back to 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>The Timeline</strong></span></p>
<p>I always know when humanity doesn&#8217;t know what the hell is going on with something when all the experts are contradicting each other about it.<a href="#footnote-34-6120" id="note-34-6120" rel="footnote">34</a>
<p>The timeline for our road to the Wizard Era is one of those times—in large part because no one knows to what extent we&#8217;ll be able to make Stevenson&#8217;s Law look more like Moore&#8217;s Law.</p>
<p>My conversations yielded a wide range of opinions on the timeline. One neuroscientist predicted that I&#8217;d have a whole-brain interface in my lifetime. Mark Zuckerberg said: &#8220;I would be pretty disappointed if in 25 years we hadn’t made some progress towards thinking things to computers.&#8221; One prediction on the longer end came from Ramez Naam, who thought the time of people beginning to install BMIs for reasons other than disability might not come for 50 years and that mass adoption would take even longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;m wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope that Elon bends the curve on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked Elon about his timeline, he said:</p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">I think we are about 8 to 10 years away from this being usable by people with no disability &#8230; It </span>is important to note that this depends heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well our devices work on people with disabilities.</em></p>
<p class="p1">During another discussion, I had asked him about why he went into this branch of biotech and not into genetics. He responded:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Genetics is just too slow, that’s the problem. For a human to become an adult takes twenty years. We just don’t have that amount of time.</em></p>
<p class="p1">A lot of people working on this challenge have a lot of different motivations for doing so, but rarely did I talk to people who felt motivated by <em>urgency.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Elon&#8217;s urgency to get us into the Wizard Era is the final piece of the Neuralink puzzle. Our last box to fill in:</p>

<p class="p1">With Elon&#8217;s companies, there&#8217;s always some &#8220;result of the goal&#8221; that&#8217;s his real reason for starting the company—the piece that ties the company&#8217;s goal into humanity&#8217;s better future. In the case of Neuralink, it&#8217;s a piece that takes a lot of tree climbing to understand. But with the view from all the way up here, we’ve got everything we need for our final stretch of the road.</p>

<p class="p1">Imagine an alien explorer is visiting a new star and finds three planets circling it, all with life on them. The first happens to be identical to the way Earth was in 10 million BC. The second happens to be identical to Earth in 50,000 BC. And the third happens to be identical to Earth in 2017 AD.</p>
<p class="p1">The alien is no expert on primitive biological life but circles around all three planets, peering down at each with his telescope. On the first, he sees lots of water and trees and mountains and some little signs of animal life. He makes out a herd of elephants on an African plain, a group of dolphins skipping along the ocean&#8217;s surface, and a few other scattered critters living out their Tuesday.</p>
<p class="p1">He moves on to the second planet and looks around. More critters, not too much different. He notices one new thing—occasional little points of flickering light dotting the land.</p>
<p class="p1">Bored, he moves on to the third planet. Whoa. He sees planes crawling around above the land, vast patches of gray land with towering buildings on them, ships of all kinds sprinkled across the seas, long railways stretching across continents, and he has to jerk his spaceship out of the way when a satellite soars by him.</p>
<p class="p1">When he heads home, he reports on what he found: &#8220;Two planets with primitive life and one planet with intelligent life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">You can understand why that would be his conclusion—but he&#8217;d be wrong.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, it&#8217;s the first planet that&#8217;s the odd one out. Both the second and third planets have intelligent life on them—equally intelligent life. So equal that you could kidnap a newborn baby from Planet 2 and swap it with a newborn on Planet 3 and both would grow up as normal people on the other&#8217;s planet, fitting in seamlessly. Same people.</p>
<p class="p1">And yet, how could that be?</p>

<p class="p1">The Human Colossus. That&#8217;s how.</p>
<p class="p1">Ever wonder why you&#8217;re so often unimpressed by humans and yet so blown away by the accomplishments of humanity?</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s because <em>humans</em> are still, deep down, those people on Planet 2.</p>
<p class="p1">Plop a baby human into a group of chimps and ask them to raise him, Tarzan style, and the human as an adult will know how to run around the forest, climb trees, find food, and masturbate. That&#8217;s who each of us actually is.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Humanity</em>, on the other hand, is a superintelligent, tremendously-knowledgeable, millennia-old Colossus, with 7.5 billion neurons. And that&#8217;s who built Planet 3.</p>
<p class="p1">The invention of language allowed each human brain to dump its knowledge onto a pile before its death, and the pile became a tower and grew taller and taller until one day, it became the brain of a great Colossus that built us a civilization. The Human Colossus has been inventing things ever since, getting continually better at it with time. Driven only by the desire to create value, the Colossus is now moving at an unprecedented pace—which is why we live in an unprecedented and completely anomalous time in history.</p>
<p class="p1">You know how I said we might be living literally <em>on </em>the line between two vast eras of communication?</p>
<p class="p1">Well the truth is, we seem to be on a <em>lot </em>of historic timeline boundaries. After 1,000 centuries of human life and 3.8 billion years of Earthly life, it seems like <em>this </em>century will be the one where Earth life makes the leap from the Single-Planetary Era to the Multi-Planetary Era. This century may be the one when an Earthly species finally manages to wrest the genetic code from the forces of evolution and learns to reprogram itself. People alive today could witness the moment when biotechnology finally frees the human lifespan from the will of nature and hands it over to the will of each individual.</p>
<p class="p1">The Human Colossus has reached an entirely new level of power—the kind of power that can overthrow 3.8-billion-year eras—positioning us on the verge of <em>multiple </em>tipping points that will lead to unimaginable change. And if our alien friend finds a fourth planet one day that happens to be identical to Earth in 2100, you can be pretty damn sure it’ll look nothing to him like Planet 3.</p>
<p class="p1">I hope you enjoyed Planet 3, because we&#8217;re leaving it. Planet 4 is where we&#8217;re headed, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" wp-image-6317 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4.png" alt="" width="313" height="385" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4.png 419w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4-244x300.png 244w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">__________</p>
<p class="p1">If I had to sum up the driving theme behind everything Elon Musk does, it would be pretty simple:</p>
<p class="p1">He wants to prepare us for Planet 4.</p>
<p class="p1">He lives in the big picture, and his only lens is the maximum zoom-out. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s such an unusual visionary. It&#8217;s also why he&#8217;s so worried.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s not that he thinks Planet 4 is definitely a bad place—it&#8217;s that he thinks it <em>could be </em>a bad place, and he recognizes that the generations alive today, whether they realize it or not, are the first in history to face real, hardcore existential risk.</p>
<p class="p1">At the same time, the people alive today also are the first who can live with the actually realistic hope for a genuinely utopian future—one that defies even death and taxes. Planet 4 could be our promised land.</p>
<p class="p1">When you zoom way out, you realize how unfathomably high the stakes actually are.</p>
<p class="p1">And the outcome isn&#8217;t at the whim of chance—it&#8217;s at the whim of the Human Colossus. Planet 4 is only coming because the Colossus is building it. And whether that future is like heaven or hell depends on what the Colossus does—maybe over the next 150 years, maybe over only the next 50. Or 25.</p>
<p class="p1">But the unfortunate thing is that the Human Colossus isn&#8217;t optimized to maximize the chances of a safe transition to the best possible Planet 4 for the most possible humans—it&#8217;s optimized to build Planet 4, in any way possible, as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Understanding all of this, Elon has dedicated his life to trying to influence the Human Colossus to bring its motivation more in line with the long-term interests of humans. He knows it&#8217;s not possible to rewire the Human Colossus—not unless existential risk were suddenly directly in front of each human&#8217;s face, which normally doesn&#8217;t happen until it&#8217;s already too late—so he treats the Colossus like a pet.</p>
<p class="p1">If you want your dog to sit, you correlate sitting on command with getting a treat. For the Human Colossus, a treat is a ripe new industry simultaneously exploding in both supply and demand.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon saw the Human Colossus dog peeing on the floor in the form of continually adding ancient, deeply-buried carbon into the carbon cycle—and rather than plead with the Colossus to stop peeing on the floor (which a lot of people waste their breath doing) or try to threaten the Colossus into behaving (which governments try to do, with limited success), he’s creating an electric car so rad that everyone will want one. The auto industry sees the shift in consumer preferences this is beginning to create, and in the nine years since Tesla released its first car, the number of major car companies with an electric car in their line went from zero to almost all of them. The Colossus seems to be taking the treat, and a change in behavior may follow.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon saw the Human Colossus dog running into traffic in the form of humanity keeping all of its eggs on one planet, despite all of those tipping points on the horizon, so he built SpaceX to learn to land a rocket, which will cut the cost of space travel by about 99% and make dedicating resources to the space industry a much tastier morsel for the Colossus. His plan with Mars isn&#8217;t to try to convince humanity that it’s a good idea to build a civilization there in order to buy life insurance for the species—it&#8217;s to create an affordable regular cargo and human transit route to Mars, knowing that once that happens, there will be enough value-creation opportunity in Mars development that the Colossus will become determined to make it happen.</p>
<p class="p1">But to Elon, the scariest thing the Human Colossus is doing is teaching the Computer Colossus to think. To Elon, and many others, the development of superintelligent AI poses by far the greatest existential threat to humanity. It&#8217;s not that hard to see why. Intelligence gives us godlike powers over all other creatures on Earth—which has not been a fun time for the creatures. If any of their body parts are possible value creators, we have major industries processing and selling those body parts. We sometimes kill them for sport. But we&#8217;re probably the least fun all the times we&#8217;re just doing our thing, for our own reasons, with no hate in our hearts or desire to hurt anyone, and there are creatures, or ecosystems, that just <em>happen </em>to be in our way or in the line of fire of the side effects of what we&#8217;re doing. People like to get all mad at humanity about this, but really, we&#8217;re just doing what species do—being selfish, first and foremost.</p>
<p class="p1">The issue for other creatures isn&#8217;t our selfishness—it&#8217;s the immense damage our selfishness can do because of the tremendous power we have over them. Power that comes from our intelligence advantage.</p>
<p class="p1">So it&#8217;s pretty logical to be apprehensive about the prospect of intentionally creating something that will have (perhaps far) more intelligence than we do—especially since every human on the planet is an amateur at creating something like that, because no one has ever done it before.</p>
<p class="p1">And things are progressing quickly. Elon talked about the rapid progress made by Google&#8217;s game-playing AI:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>I mean, you’ve got these two things where AlphaGo crushes these human players head-on-head, beats Lee Sedol 4 out of 5 games and now it will beat a human every game all the time, while playing the 50 best players, and beating them always, all the time. You know, that’s like one year later. </em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>And it’s on a harmless thing like AlphaGo right now. But the degrees of freedom at which the AI can win are increasing. So, Go has many more degrees of freedom than Chess, but if you take something like one of the real-time strategy competitive games like League of Legends or Dota 2, that has vastly more degrees of freedom than Go, so it can’t win at that yet. But it will be able to. And then there’s reality, which has the ultimate number of degrees of freedom.</em><a href="#footnote-35-6120" id="note-35-6120" rel="footnote">35</a>
<p class="p1">And for reasons discussed above, that kind of thing worries him:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>What I came to realize in recent years—the last couple years—is that AI is obviously going to surpass human intelligence by a lot. … There’s some risk at that point that something bad happens, something that we can’t control, that humanity can’t control after that point—either a small group of people monopolize AI power, or the AI goes rogue, or something like that. It may not, but it could.</em></p>
<p class="p1">But in typical Human Colossus form, &#8220;the collective will is not attuned to the danger of AI.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">When I interviewed Elon in 2015, I asked him if he would ever join the effort to build superintelligent AI. He said, &#8220;My honest opinion is that we shouldn’t build it.&#8221; And when I later commented that building something smarter than yourself did seem like a basic Darwinian error (a phrase I stole from Nick Bostrom), Elon responded, &#8220;We’re gonna win the Darwin Award, collectively.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Now, two years later, here&#8217;s what he says:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>I was trying to really sound the alarm on the AI front for quite a while, but it was clearly having no impact (laughs) so I was like, &#8220;Oh fine, okay, then we’ll have to try to help develop it in a way that’s good.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="p1">He’s accepted reality—the Human Colossus is not going to quit until the Computer Colossus, one day, wakes up. This is happening.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6442" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker.png" alt="" width="500" height="684" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker.png 1096w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker-219x300.png 219w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker-768x1051.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker-438x600.png 438w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">No matter what anyone tells you, no one knows what will happen when the Computer Colossus learns to think. In my <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long AI explainer</a>, I explored the reasoning of both those who are convinced that superintelligent AI will be the solution to every problem we have, and those who see humanity as a bunch of kids playing with a bomb they don’t understand. I’m personally still torn about which camp I find more convincing, but it seems pretty rational to plan for the worst and do whatever we can to increase our odds. Many experts agree with that logic, but there’s little consensus on the best strategy for creating superintelligent AI safely—just a whole lot of ideas from people who acknowledge they don&#8217;t really know the answer. How could anyone know how to take precautions for a future world they have no way to understand?</p>
<p class="p1">Elon also acknowledges he doesn&#8217;t know the answer—but he&#8217;s working on a plan he thinks will give us our best shot.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Elon&#8217;s Plan</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-align: center;">Abraham Lincoln was pleased with himself when he came up with the line:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em>—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Fair—it&#8217;s a good line.</p>
<p class="p1">The whole idea of &#8220;of the people, by the people, for the people&#8221; is the centerpiece of democracy.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, &#8220;the people&#8221; are unpleasant. So democracy ends up being unpleasant. But unpleasant tends to be a dream compared to the alternatives. Elon talked about this:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>I think that the protection of the collective is important. I think it was Churchill who said, “Democracy’s the worst of all systems of government, except for all the others.” It’s fine if you have Plato’s incredible philosopher king as the king, sure. That would be fine. Now, most dictators do not turn out that way. They tend to be quite horrible.</em></p>
<p class="p1">In other words, democracy is like escaping from a monster by hiding in a sewer.</p>
<p class="p1">There are plenty of times in life when it’s a good strategy to take a risk in order to give yourself a chance for the best possible outcome, but when the stakes are at their absolute highest, the right move is usually to play it safe. Power is one of those times. That&#8217;s why, even though democracy essentially guarantees a certain level of mediocrity, Elon says, &#8220;I think you’re hard-pressed to find many people in the United States who, no matter what they think of any given president, would advocate for a dictatorship.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">And since Elon sees AI as the ultimate power, he sees AI development as the ultimate &#8220;play it safe&#8221; situation. Which is why his strategy for minimizing existential AI risk seems to essentially be that AI power needs to be of the people, by the people, for the people.</p>
<p class="p1">To try to implement that concept in the realm of AI, Elon has approached the situation from multiple angles.</p>
<p class="p1">For the<strong> by the people</strong> and <strong>for the people</strong><strong> </strong>parts, he and Sam Altman created <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a>—a self-described &#8220;non-profit AI research company, discovering and enacting the path to safe artificial general intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Normally, when humanity is working on something new, it starts with the work of a few innovative pioneers. When they succeed, an industry is born and the Human Colossus jumps on board to build upon what the pioneers started, en masse.</p>
<p class="p1">But what if the thing those pioneers were working on was a magic wand that might give whoever owned it immense, unbreakable power over everyone else—including the power to prevent anyone else from making a magic wand? That would be kinda stressful, right?</p>
<p class="p1">Well that&#8217;s how Elon views today&#8217;s early AI development efforts. And since he can&#8217;t stop people from trying to make a magic wand, his solution is to create an open, collaborative, transparent magic wand development lab. When a new breakthrough innovation is discovered in the lab, instead of making it a tightly-kept secret like the other magic wand companies, the lab publishes the innovation for anyone to see or borrow for their own magic-wand-making efforts.</p>
<p class="p1">On one hand, this could have drawbacks. Bad guys are out there trying to make a magic wand too, and you <em>really </em>don&#8217;t want the first magic wand to end up in the hands of a bad guy. And now the bad guys&#8217; development efforts can benefit from all of the innovations being published by the lab. This is a serious concern.</p>
<p class="p1">But the lab also boosts the efforts of millions of other people trying to create magic wands. This generates a ton of competition for the secretive early pioneers, and it becomes less likely that any one inventor can create a magic wand long before others also do. More likely is that when the first magic wand is eventually created, there are thousands of others near completion as well—different wands, with different capabilities, made by different people, for different reasons. If we have to have magic wands on Earth, Elon thinks, let&#8217;s at least make sure they&#8217;re in the hands of a large number of people across the world—not one all-powerful sorcerer. Or as he puts it:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Essentially, if everyone’s from planet Krypton, that’s great. But if only one of them is Superman and Superman also has the personality of Hitler, then we’ve got a problem.</em></p>
<p class="p1">More broadly, a single pioneer&#8217;s magic wand would likely have been built to serve that inventor&#8217;s own needs and purposes. But by turning the future magic wand industry into a collective effort, a wide variety of needs and purposes will have a wand made for them, making it more likely that the capabilities of the world&#8217;s aggregate mass of magic wands will overarchingly represent the needs of the masses.</p>
<p class="p1">You know, like democracy.</p>
<p class="p1">It worked fine for Nikola Tesla and Henry Ford and the Wright Brothers and Alan Turing to jump-start revolutions by jumping way out ahead of the pack. But when you&#8217;re dealing with the invention of something <em>unthinkably</em> powerful, you can&#8217;t sit back and let the pioneers kick things off—it’s leaving too much to chance.</p>
<p class="p1">OpenAI is an effort to democratize the creation of AI, to get the entire Human Colossus working on it during its pioneer phase. Elon sums it up:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>AI is definitely going to vastly surpass human abilities. To the degree that it is linked to human will, particularly the sum of a large number of humans, it would be an outcome that is desired by a large number of humans, because it would be a function of their will.</em></p>
<p class="p1">So now you&#8217;ve maybe got early human-level-or-higher AI superpower being made by the people, for the people—which brings down the likelihood that the world’s AI ends up in the hands of a single bad guy or a tightly-controlled monopoly.</p>
<p class="p1">Now all we&#8217;ve got left is <strong>of the people.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">This one should be easy. Remember, the Human Colossus is creating superintelligent AI for the same reason it created cars, factory machines, and computers—to serve as an extension of itself to which it can outsource work. Cars do our walking, factory machines do our manufacturing, and computers take care of information storage, organization, and computation.</p>
<p class="p1">Creating computers that can think will be our greatest invention yet—they’ll allow us to outsource our most important and high-impact work. Thinking is what built everything we have, so just imagine the power that will come from building ourselves a superintelligent thinking <em>extension. </em>And extensions of the people by definition belong to the people—they’re <em>of </em>the people.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s just this one thing—</p>
<p class="p1">High-caliber AI isn’t quite like those other inventions. The rest of our technology is great at the thing it’s built to do, but in the end, it’s a mindless machine with narrow intelligence. The AI we’re trying to build will be <em>smart, </em>like a person—like a <em>ridiculously </em>smart person. It’s a fundamentally different thing than we’ve ever made before—so why would we expect normal rules to apply?</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s always been an automatic thing that the technology we make inherently belongs to us—it’s such an obvious point that it almost seems silly to make it. But could it be that if we make something smarter than a person, it might not be so easy to control?</p>
<p class="p1">Could it be that a creation that’s better at thinking than any human on Earth might not be fully content to serve as a human extension, even if that’s what it was built to do?</p>
<p class="p1">We don’t know how issues will actually manifest—but it seems pretty safe to say that yes, these possibilities <em>could be.</em></p>
<p class="p1">And if what could be turns out to <em>actually </em>be<em>, </em>we may have a serious problem on our hands.</p>
<p class="p1">Because, as the human history case study suggests, when there’s something on the planet way smarter than everyone else, it can be a really bad thing for everyone else. And if AI becomes the new thing on the planet that’s way smarter than everyone else, and it turns out <em>not </em>to clearly belong to us—it means that it’s its <em>own thing</em>. Which drops us into the category of “everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So <em>people </em>gaining monopolistic control of AI is its own problem—and one that OpenAI is hoping to solve. But it&#8217;s a problem that may pale in comparison to the prospect of AI being uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="p1">This is what keeps Elon up at night. He sees it as only a matter of time before superintelligent AI rises up on this planet—and when that happens, he believes that it’s critical that we don’t end up as part of “everyone else.”</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why, in a future world made up of AI and everyone else, he thinks we have only one good option:</p>
<p class="p1">To be AI.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p class="p1">Remember before when I said that there were two things about wizard hats we had to wrap our heads around?</p>
<p><strong>1) The intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) The super ridiculously intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p>
<p class="p1">This is where #2 comes in.</p>
<p class="p1">These two ideas are the two things Elon means when he refers to the wizard hat as a digital tertiary layer in our brains. The first, as we discussed, is the concept that a whole-brain interface is kind of the same thing as putting our devices in our heads—effectively making your <em>brain </em>the device. Like this: <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6471" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2.png 1390w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2-300x224.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2-768x573.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2-600x448.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Your devices give you cyborg superpowers and a window into the digital world. Your brain’s wizard hat electrode array is a new brain structure, joining your limbic system and cortex.</p>
<p class="p1">But your limbic system, cortex, and wizard hat are just the hardware systems. When you experience your limbic system, it’s not the physical system you’re interacting with—it’s the <em>information flow </em>within it. It’s the <em>activity</em> of the physical system that bubbles up in your consciousness, making you feel angry, scared, horny, or hungry.</p>
<p class="p1">Same thing for your cortex. The napkin wrapped around your brain stores and organizes information, but it’s the information itself that you experience when you think something, see something, hear something, or feel something. The visual cortex in itself does nothing for you—it’s the stream of photon information flowing through it that gives you the experience of having a visual cortex. When you dig in your memory to find something, you’re not searching for <em>neurons</em>, you’re searching for information stored in the neurons.</p>
<p class="p1">The limbic system and cortex themselves are just gray matter. The flow of activity within the gray matter is what forms your familiar internal characters, the monkey brain and the rational human brain.</p>
<p class="p1">So what does that mean about your digital tertiary layer?</p>
<p class="p1">It means that while what’s actually in your brain is the physical device—the electrode array itself—the component of the tertiary layer that you’ll experience and get to know as a character is the information that flows through the array.</p>
<p class="p1">And just like the feelings and urges of the limbic system and the thoughts and chattering voice of the cortex all feel to you like <em>parts </em>of you—like your inner essence—the activity that flows through your wizard hat will feel like a part of you and your essence.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon’s vision for the Wizard Era is that among the wizard hat’s many uses, one of its core purposes will be to serve as the interface between your brain and a cloud-based customized AI system. That AI system, he believes, will become as present a character in your mind as your monkey and your human characters—and it will feel like <em>you </em>every bit as much as the others do. He says:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>I think that, conceivably, there’s a way for there to be a tertiary layer that feels like it’s part of you. It’s not some thing that you offload to, it’s you.</em></p>
<p class="p1">This makes sense on paper. You do most of your &#8220;thinking&#8221; with your cortex, but then when you get hungry, you don&#8217;t say, &#8220;My limbic system is hungry,&#8221; you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221; Likewise, Elon thinks, when you&#8217;re trying to figure out the solution to a problem and your AI comes up with the answer, you won&#8217;t say, &#8220;My AI got it,&#8221; you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Aha! I got it.&#8221; When your limbic system wants to procrastinate and your cortex wants to work, a situation I <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might</a> be familiar with, it doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re<em> </em>arguing with some external being, it feels like a singular <em>you</em> is struggling to be disciplined. Likewise, when you think up a strategy at work and your AI disagrees, that&#8217;ll be a genuine disagreement and a debate will ensue—but it will feel like an <em>internal </em>debate, not a debate between you and someone else that just happens to take place in your thoughts. The debate will feel like <em>thinking. </em></p>
<p class="p1">It makes sense on paper.</p>
<p class="p1">But when I first heard Elon talk about this concept, it didn’t really feel right. No matter how hard I tried to get it, I kept framing the idea as something familiar—like an AI system whose <em>voice </em>I could hear in my head, or even one that I could think together with. But in those instances, the AI still seemed like an external system I was communicating with. It didn’t seem like <em>me</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">But then, one night while working on the post, I was rereading some of Elon’s quotes about this, and it suddenly <em>clicked. </em>The AI <em>would </em>be me. <em>Fully</em>. I <em>got </em>it.</p>
<p class="p1">Then I lost it. The next day, I tried to explain the epiphany to a friend and I left us both confused. I was back in “Wait, but it kind of wouldn’t really <em>be </em>me, it would be <em>communicating </em>with me” land. Since then, I’ve dipped into and out of the idea, never quite able to hold it for long. The best thing I can compare it to is having a moment when it actually makes <em>sense </em>that time is relative and space-time is a single fabric. For a second, it seems <em>intuitive </em>that time moves slower when you’re moving really fast. And then I lose it. As I typed those sentences just now, it did <em>not </em>seem intuitive.</p>
<p class="p1">The idea of <em>being </em>AI is especially tough because it combines <em>two </em>mind-numbing concepts—the brain interface and the abilities it would give you, and artificial general intelligence. Humans today are simply not equipped to understand either of those things, because as imaginative as we think we are, our imaginations only really have our life experience as their toolkit, and these concepts are both totally novel. It’s like trying to imagine a color you’ve never seen.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why when I hear Elon talk with conviction about this stuff, I’m somewhere in between deeply believing it myself and taking his word for it. I go back and forth. But given that he’s someone who probably found space-time intuitive when he was seven, and given that he’s someone who knows how to colonize Mars, I’m inclined to listen hard to what he says.</p>
<p class="p1">And what he says is that this is all about bandwidth. It’s obvious why bandwidth matters when it comes to making a wizard hat useful. But Elon believes that when it comes to interfacing with AI, high bandwidth isn’t just <em>preferred,</em> but actually <em>fundamental </em>to the prospect of being AI, versus simply <em>using </em>AI. Here he is walking me through his thoughts:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The challenge is the communication bandwidth is extremely slow, particularly output. When you’re outputting on a phone, you’re moving two thumbs very slowly. That’s crazy slow communication. … If the bandwidth is too low, then your integration with AI would be very weak. Given the limits of very low bandwidth, it’s kind of pointless. The AI is just going to go by itself, because it’s too slow to talk to. The faster the communication, the more you’ll be integrated—the slower the communication, the less. And the more separate we are—the more the AI is “other”—the more likely it is to turn on us. If the AIs are all separate, and vastly more intelligent than us, how do you ensure that they don’t have optimization functions that are contrary to the best interests of humanity? … If we achieve tight symbiosis, the AI wouldn’t be “other”—it would be you and with a relationship to your cortex analogous to the relationship your cortex has with your limbic system.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Elon sees communication bandwidth as the key factor in determining our level of integration with AI, and he sees that level of integration as the key factor in how we’ll fare in the AI world of our future:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>We’re going to have the choice of either being left behind and being effectively useless or like a pet—you know, like a house cat or something—or eventually figuring out some way to be symbiotic and merge with AI.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Then, a second later:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>A house cat’s a good outcome, by the way.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without really understanding what kinds of AI will be around when we reach the age of superintelligent AI, the idea that human-AI integration will lend itself to the protection of the species makes intuitive sense. Our vulnerabilities in the AI era will come from bad people in control of AI or rogue AI not aligned with human values. In a world in which millions of people control a little piece of the world&#8217;s aggregate AI power—people who can think with AI, can defend themselves with AI, and who fundamentally understand AI because of their own integration with it—humans are less vulnerable. People will be a lot more powerful, which is scary, but like Elon said, if everyone is Superman, it&#8217;s harder for any one Superman to cause harm on a mass scale—there are lots of checks and balances. And we&#8217;re less likely to lose control of AI in general because the AI on the planet will be so widely distributed and varied in its goals. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But time is of the essence here—something Elon emphasized:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The pace of progress in this direction matters a lot. We don’t want to develop digital superintelligence too far before being able to do a merged brain-computer interface.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I thought about all of this, one reservation I had was whether a whole-brain interface would be enough of a change to make integration likely. I brought this up with Elon, noting that there would still be a vast difference between our thinking speed and a computer’s thinking speed. He said:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Yes, but increasing bandwidth by orders of magnitude would make it better. And it’s directionally correct. Does it solve all problems? No. But is it directionally correct? Yes. If you’re going to go in some direction, well, why would you go in any direction other than this?</em></p>
<p class="p1">And that’s why Elon started Neuralink.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6448" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1.png 2240w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1-300x183.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1-768x468.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1-600x365.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">He started Neuralink to accelerate our pace into the Wizard Era—into a world where he says that “everyone who wants to have this AI extension of themselves could have one, so there would be billions of individual human-AI symbiotes who, collectively, make decisions about the future.” A world where AI really could be of the people, by the people, for the people.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6445" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1.png" alt="" width="500" height="704" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1.png 1096w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1-213x300.png 213w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1-768x1082.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1-426x600.png 426w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll guess that right now, some part of you believes this insane world we’ve been living in for the past 38,000 words could really maybe be the future—and another part of you refuses to believe it. I’ve got a little of both of those going on too.</p>
<p class="p1">But the <em>insanity</em> part of it shouldn’t be the reason it’s hard to believe. Remember—George Washington died when he saw 2017. And our future <em>will </em>be unfathomably shocking to us. The only difference is that things are moving even faster now than they were in George’s time.</p>
<p class="p1">The concept of being blown away by the future speaks to the magic of our collective intelligence—but it also speaks to the naivety of our intuition. Our minds evolved in a time when progress moved at a snail’s pace, so that’s what our hardware is calibrated to. And if we don’t actively override our intuition—the part of us that reads about a future this outlandish and refuses to believe it’s possible—we’re living in denial.</p>
<p class="p1">The reality is that we’re whizzing down a <em>very </em>intense road to a very intense place, and no one knows what it’ll be like when we get there. A lot of people find it scary to think about, but I think it’s exciting. Because of when we happened to be born, instead of just living in a normal world like normal people, we’re living inside of a <em>thriller </em>movie. Some people take this information and decide to be like Elon, doing whatever they can to help the movie have a happy ending—and thank god they do. Because I’d rather just be a gawking member of the audience, watching the movie from the edge of my seat and rooting for the good guys.</p>

Gray and white matter have different densities. So when your head is punched hard, or you get a really bad concussion, what can happen if your head snaps back and forth really sharply is that the gray and white matter accelerate at different velocities, which can make the gray matter of your cortex slide a bit over the white matter, or the white matter slide a bit over the gray matter of the brain stem. In the latter case, for a brief moment, your cortex is separated from being able to communicate with your brainstem. And since your consciousness resides in the brain stem, it makes you go unconscious. When either type of sliding happens, it can tear a bunch of axons. In a minor axon tear where the myelin sheath is still intact, the axon can grow back and heal. But if it&#8217;s a sharp enough blow, the myelin sheaths can tear too and the axons will never grow back—permanent brain damage. Concussions are really, really bad. This is also why an uppercut to the bottom of the chin or a blow to the back of the head can cause loss of consciousness—because those blows make the head snap back and forth sharply—while a punch to the side of the head or to the forehead won&#8217;t cause loss of consciousness.<a href="#note-16-6120" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-16.footnote--><li id="footnote-17-6120" class="footnote"><p>If our stick guy neuron were one of those sensory neurons, drawn to scale, his torso-axon would have been about a kilometer long.<a href="#note-17-6120" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-17.footnote--><li id="footnote-18-6120" class="footnote"><p>Sometimes, like when you step on a nail or touch a hot stove, the sensory axons will communicate with relevant motor neurons directly in the spinal cord to create an immediate reflex to pull your foot or hand away.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people sleep about seven or eight hours a night. That leaves 16 or 17 hours awake each day. Or about 1,000 minutes.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s think about those 1,000 minutes as 100 10-minute blocks. That&#8217;s what you wake up with every day.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-a-day.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5813" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-a-day.png" alt="100-blocks-a-day" width="240" height="438" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-a-day.png 488w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-a-day-165x300.png 165w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-a-day-329x600.png 329w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a></p>
<p>Throughout the day, you spend 10 minutes of your life on each block, until you eventually run out of blocks and it&#8217;s time to go to sleep.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-block.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5816" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-block.jpg" alt="1-block" width="640" height="490" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-block.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-block-300x230.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-block-768x589.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1-block-600x460.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always good to step back and think about how we&#8217;re using those 100 blocks we get each day. How many of them are put towards making your future better, and how many of them are just there to be enjoyed? How many of them are spent with other people, and how many are for time by yourself? How many are used to create something, and how many are used to consume something? How many of the blocks are focused on your body, how many on your mind, and how many on neither one in particular? Which are your favorite blocks of the day, and which are your least favorite?</p>
<p>Imagine these blocks laid out on a grid. What if you had to label each one with a purpose?</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-pdf.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5812" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks.png" alt="100-blocks" width="506" height="504" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks.png 1364w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-150x150.png 150w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-300x300.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-768x765.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/100-blocks-600x597.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;d have to think about everything you might spend your time doing in the context of its worth in blocks. Cooking dinner requires three blocks, while ordering in requires zero—is cooking dinner worth three blocks to you? Is 10 minutes of meditation a day important enough to dedicate a block to it? Reading 20 minutes a night allows you to read 15 additional books a year—is that worth two blocks? If your favorite recreation is playing video games, you&#8217;d have to consider the value you place on fun before deciding how many blocks it warrants. Getting a drink with a friend after work takes up about 10 blocks. How often do you want to use 10 blocks for that purpose, and on which friends? Which blocks should be treated as non-negotiable in their labeled purpose and which should be more flexible? Which blocks should be left blank, with no assigned purpose at all?</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Desk.png" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-5814 aligncenter" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Desk.png" alt="desk" width="500" height="367" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Desk.png 1143w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Desk-300x220.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Desk-768x563.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Desk-600x440.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Now imagine a similar grid, but one where each block is labeled exactly how you spent it yesterday.</p>
<p>The question to ask is: How are the two grids different from each other, and why?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tip: the above grid is printable if you click on it.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, I took the time to transcribe the entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooShpws3Dik">second presidential debate</a>. Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<p><strong>Martha Raddatz: </strong>Hi I&#8217;m Martha.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson Cooper: </strong>And I&#8217;m Anderson. And we&#8217;ll be your moderators tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>We&#8217;d like to remind all audience members that they&#8217;re props more than anything and should stay silent through the debate. The format of the debate will be a series of questions from members of the audience. We&#8217;ll start with a woman named Patrice Brock.</p>
<p><em><strong>Audience Question: </strong>Thank you and good evening. The last presidential debate could have been rated as MA—mature audiences—per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students&#8217; homework, do you feel that you are modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today&#8217;s youth?</em></p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>I want to do all kinds of things. I want to do good things. There&#8217;s nothing we can&#8217;t do together, you and me Patrice. I want to work with people of all ethnicities. I want to heal the country. Make it a better place. For you and for me and the entire human race. And our children. And grandchildren.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>This country&#8217;s going to shit. Healthcare costs are going up. We made Iran great again. We get killed on trade—an $800 billion deficit last year. We&#8217;re gonna make great trade deals. We&#8217;re gonna bring back law and order. Did you hear about those policemen that were shot today? We need justice. I want to fix the blacks in the cities. I want to fix the Latinos, Hispanics, etc. I want to make them great again. Make America great again.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson Cooper: </strong>Neither of you remotely answered the question, whatsoever. You literally both ignored Patrice. Anyway, I also don&#8217;t care about Patrice. Let&#8217;s talk about the tapes. Donald, you talked about kissing women without consent. Grabbing them by the pussy. That&#8217;s really very much definitely sexual assault. You bragged about sexually assaulting women. This is a real thing that happened. It is a thing that&#8217;s real.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Wrong. I don&#8217;t think you understand what sexual assault is. Grabbing women by the pussy is locker room talk. Assaulting women is grabbing them by the pussy. I&#8217;m sorry I grabbed women by the pussy. I never did that. And how can you say that&#8217;s worse than ISIS? ISIS is beheading thousands of people. How can you compare me to ISIS? They drown people in steel cages. I&#8217;ve never done that once. How dare you Anderson. We&#8217;ll see tomorrow what the American people have to say about you saying that ISIS isn&#8217;t a big deal. What do you think our enemies are saying when they see what&#8217;s going on here. Yes, it was locker room talk. Yes, I hate it. I have advanced strategies for ISIS. I will defeat ISIS.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>Okay, but do you assault women?</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody. Not Mister Rogers. Not Susan B. Anthony. No one. Moving on a married woman is a sign of respect. I&#8217;m what every parent hopes their daughter marries. All women respect me.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>But like literally—do you assault women?</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Only with my respect. We&#8217;re gonna build a wall. We&#8217;re gonna have borders. People are pouring into our country from the Middle East to grab American women by the pussy. We&#8217;re gonna make America safe again. We&#8217;re gonna make America great again. We&#8217;re gonna make America safe again. We&#8217;re gonna make America wealthy again. China.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Reagan. Bush. Eisenhower. Did they grab women by the arm? Yes. By the hand? Probably. Around the shoulder? Sure. But by the pussy? I don&#8217;t think so. Donald Trump is a bad man. He&#8217;s an everything-ist. He&#8217;s Matt Damon in <em>School Ties</em>. He&#8217;s the uncle in <em>The Long Walk Home</em>. He&#8217;s the mean slave owner in <em>12 Years a Slave</em>. He&#8217;s the main German guy in <em>Die Hard.</em> He&#8217;s the woman in <em>The Grudge</em>. He&#8217;s Bluto. He&#8217;s Jafar. He&#8217;s the Joker. He&#8217;s a white walker. He&#8217;s a death eater. He&#8217;s a zombie. He&#8217;s a ghost. I, on the other hand, want to form one of those huge circles of different colored people that stretches all the way around the Earth where everyone&#8217;s holding hands. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>30 years. 30 years this lady&#8217;s running the country and never once have I, nor has anyone else, been part of a circle of different colored people that stretches all the way around the Earth where everyone&#8217;s holding hands. 30 years of this fucking lady and never once did she paint anything with paint, let alone the colors of the wind.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Okay but back to your locker room assault. You&#8217;ve said that this campaign has changed you—that though being a clear predator in that video at the age of 59, you&#8217;ve now become good. Is that really true?</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Martha—I don&#8217;t know how much clearer I can make this. I told detailed assault stories that included specific dates, names, and body parts. That&#8217;s just classic locker room talk. Every guy talks to other guys about detailed stories of his previous assaults that include specific dates, names, and body parts. You don&#8217;t know this because you&#8217;re not there—but whenever guys are alone, they talk about their previous assaults. That doesn&#8217;t mean they assaulted anyone. Unless they&#8217;re Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is a bad fucking dude. Bill Clinton told me about when he held a Taco Bell employee down by the neck in the restaurant&#8217;s utilities closet and had intercourse with her. Bill Clinton told me about having a foursome with Chelsea&#8217;s three best friends while Chelsea was sleeping upstairs. Hillary missed it because she was busy laughing at a 12-year-old rape victim who by coincidence is sitting right over there.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Nicely done. Hillary?</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>I&#8217;ll let Michelle Obama do the talking here. She said, &#8220;When someone talks about that time when your husband held a Taco Bell employee down by the neck in the restaurant&#8217;s utilities closet and had intercourse with her, you go high.&#8221; Also, you insulted a Muslim war hero&#8217;s parents and said a Latino judge was inherently biased and mocked a disabled reporter and said Obama was foreign.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The first three, sure. But <em>you&#8217;re </em>the one who said Obama was foreign. Also, Michelle Obama has openly said you&#8217;re the worst ever. Also, you cheated to beat Bernie Sanders. Also, you deleted 33,000 emails you sneaky fuck. And when I&#8217;m Führer, I&#8217;m hiring a special prosecutor to come after you.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>He&#8217;s lying about everything, it&#8217;s all on my website, and let&#8217;s just be happy that this loose cannon isn&#8217;t in charge of the law in this country.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Because you&#8217;d be in jail.</p>
<p><strong>Audience: </strong>Oh dayome!</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>We&#8217;d like to remind the audience to stop being a piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>But really, Hillary—what&#8217;s up with the emails you sneaky fuck.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>It was a mistake. I wrote 33,000 emails about Chelsea&#8217;s wedding and a yoga class, and I shouldn&#8217;t have deleted them. Now let&#8217;s get to the questions from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Of course—anything to divert from this question, you crooked shrew.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Anything to divert from your campaign, you incompressible jizztrumpet.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong><em>That&#8217;s </em>enough. Now let&#8217;s resume this town hall farce with our second audience question.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Typical.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You never ask Hillary about her emails. You never spend time with me. You don&#8217;t care about me. This is one on three.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>No it&#8217;s not. Just a little. Next question.</p>
<p><strong><em>Audience Question:</em></strong><em> Obamacare made things more expensive, not less. How will you bring healthcare costs down?</em></p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Well—</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>No Hillary&#8217;s supposed to go first here.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No it&#8217;s fine I&#8217;d rather go second.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No it&#8217;s fine you go first.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No you.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No you.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No you.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No you.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No you.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No you.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Obamacare is good.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Obamacare is a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>Hillary, your husband Bill also said Obamacare is a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No he didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Bernie Sanders says Hillary has bad judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>Let&#8217;s move on. Audience question.</p>
<p><strong><em>Audience Question: </em></strong><em>I&#8217;m a Muslim. How can you help me not be hatecrimed?</em></p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Being hatecrimed is a shame. But we have a problem. Which is that you&#8217;re not telling us when the other Muslims are gonna kill us. In San Bernardino, there were Muslims that killed us and you didn&#8217;t tell us about them. If you had told us about them, we could have stopped it. I don&#8217;t think you ever told us about Orlando either, or 9/11 for that matter. I know that because if you had told us about 9/11, I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;d be famous, and famous people don&#8217;t go to town hall meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>You are Muslim. I am Muslim. Captain Khan, who died serving this country and who Donald hates, was Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Hey Donald, remember your Muslim ban? Let&#8217;s discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I love Captain Khan. I have his name tattooed on my lower back. An American hero. Who Hillary killed by starting the Iraq War, another thing I hate.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Fuckin—dude—no. Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Who made you so mean? Was it your parents?</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Does the Muslim ban still hold?</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Hillary wants to merge the US with Syria into one nation. She wants to increase the number of refugees from 10,000 to 65,000.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>What the fuck Hillary?</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>That picture of the dead four-year-old boy on the beach with the little sneakers.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Totes.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Also, Donald literally wants to ban an entire major religion from entering the US. Can we just all reflect on that for a second? And also, he started the Iraq War, not me.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I was against the war in Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No you weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yes I was.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No you weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yes I was.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>No you weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yes I was. Bernie Sanders says Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Okay new question. Hillary, you said in a secret speech that politicians need both a public and private position on certain issues. Is it okay for politicians to be two-faced?</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>That was Abraham Lincoln, not me. More importantly, Trump is obsessed with Putin.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I&#8217;m not obsessed with Putin. I paid taxes. I took deductions. Hillary&#8217;s friends took deductions. Hillary is friends with rich people.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>The fuck? Okay well now that we&#8217;re here:</p>
<p><em><strong>Audience Question: </strong>How will you ensure that wealthy Americans pay their fair share of taxes?</em></p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Well the first thing I&#8217;d do is (by the way one of the first provisions is (by the way you know I give up a lot when I run cause I change the tax code (by the way you know she could have done this years ago but she didn&#8217;t because her rich friends don&#8217;t want her to (30 fucking years, folks—30 years with this lady and nothing changes—nothing ever will change)))) get rid of carried interest. I&#8217;m also lowering taxes on the wealthy, and by the way Hillary is raising your taxes, which is a disaster. There&#8217;s no growth in this country. This country&#8217;s going to shit. China&#8217;s killing us.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Literally all lies from this douche again. He will cut taxes for the super rich and raise them for the middle class.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yeah and she&#8217;ll close corporate loopholes—as long as they&#8217;re ones her rich friends don&#8217;t use. Also, Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgment. 30 fucking years, folks, with this lady. 30—</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>30 years my dick, Donald. I&#8217;ve done 400 legislation things in 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Nah.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>New question. Aleppo&#8217;s in the shit. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>We need to stand up to Russia and Assad and save Aleppo.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>And save who in Aleppo, the rebels? They&#8217;re worse than Assad. We need to fight ISIS.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>But Mr. Trump, your running mate agrees with Hillary. He even wants to use military force to stand up to Russia and Assad.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Well he&#8217;s dumb. We need to be fighting ISIS. I know more about ISIS than the generals.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Fucking no you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>Audience question.</p>
<p><em><strong>Audience Question: </strong></em><em>Do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the US? </em></p>
<p><strong>Trump:</strong> I want to help all Americans. The black Americans. The Latino<em> </em>Americanos personas. The Indian chiefs. Our cities are a disaster. Our education is a disaster. Poverty is a disaster. Natural disasters are a disaster. She said basket of deplorables.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>I want to help all Americans—the deplorables and the non-deplorables. I talked to an Ethopian kid who was scared of Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>But what&#8217;s up with the deplorables thing?</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>I only meant that truthfully, not publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>She has tremendous hate in her heart. The hate in her heart is a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>So Donald, remember when you kind of woke up in the middle of the night the other night and went on a 3am tirade attacking that random woman and telling people to watch her sex tape? What was&#8230;what was the deal with that?</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>That slut.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson:</strong> Let&#8217;s move on to the next question, from a man named Kenneth Bone.</p>
<p><em><strong>Audience Question: </strong>I&#8217;m Kenneth Bone. I&#8217;m Kenneth Bone and I&#8217;m wearing this sweater. And this is my mustache.</em></p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>Is that. Is that it?</p>
<p><em><strong>Kenneth Bone: </strong>What&#8217;s your plan with energy policy?</em></p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Coal. Coal is the way of the future. China is KILLING us. China is dumping steel on us.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>China is dumping steel on your shitty face. You buy a ton of Chinese steel. Climate change is a thing. Coal is a thing. Things are things.</p>
<p><strong>Martha: </strong>Okay last question, thank fucking god.</p>
<p><em><strong>Audience Question: </strong>It sounds kind of fun and hilarious to make you two </em><em>say something nice about each other.</em> <em>Go.</em></p>
<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>His kids aren&#8217;t terrible people. Somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The bitch can fight.</p>
<p><strong>Anderson: </strong>I&#8217;d like to extend my thanks and apologies to the 790 million people who watched this. Goodnight.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Elon Musk got on stage at the 2016 International Astronautical Congress and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled the first real details</a> about the big fucking rocket they&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>A couple months ago, when SpaceX first announced that this would be happening in late September, it hit me that I might still have special privileges with them, kind of grandfathered in from my time working with Elon and his companies in 2015 (which resulted in <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an in-depth four-part blog series</a>). So I reached out and asked if I could learn about the big fucking rocket ahead of time and write a post about it.</p>
<p>They said yes.</p>
<p>A little while later, I got on a call with Elon to discuss the rocket, the timeline, and the big plan this was all a part of. We started off how we always do.</p>

<p>Then I brought up the rocket.</p>

<p>Eventually, we were able to settle in to a fascinating conversation about this insane machine SpaceX is building and what&#8217;s going to happen with it.</p>
<p>Now, before we get into things—</p>
<p>This post is only a piece of The SpaceX Story—one of the most amazing stories of our time—and a story I spent three months and 40,000 words telling last year. If you really want to understand this and you haven&#8217;t read that post yet, I recommend you start there.

<p>For those who have read the post and want a refresher or those who just want to hear about the big fucking rocket and move on with their day, here&#8217;s a quick overview of the background:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 22pt;"><strong>The Context</strong></span></p>
<p>To understand why the big fucking rocket matters, you have to understand this sentence:</p>
<p><em>SpaceX is trying to make human life multi-planetary by building a self-sustaining, one-million-person civilization on Mars.</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go part by part.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why make human life multi-planetary?</strong></span></p>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1) It&#8217;s fun and exciting.</strong> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/waitbutwhy/2-reasons-to-go-to-mars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&#8217;s a clip</a> from one of the interviews I did with Elon last year where he articulates this point.)</p>
<p><strong>2) It&#8217;s not a great idea to have all of our eggs in one basket. </strong>Right now we&#8217;re all on Earth, which means that if something terrible happens on Earth—caused by nature or by our own technology—we&#8217;re done. That&#8217;s like having a precious digital photo album saved only on one not-necessarily-reliable hard drive. If you were in that situation, you&#8217;d be smart to back the album up on a second hard drive. That&#8217;s the idea here. Elon calls it &#8220;life insurance for the species.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why Mars?</strong></span></p>
<p>Venus is a dick, with its lead-melting temperatures, its crushing atmospheric pressure, and its unbearable winds.</p>
<p>The moon has few natural resources, a 29-day day, and with no atmosphere to either provide protection against the sun during the day or warm things up at night, both day and night become murderous. Same deal on Mercury.</p>
<p>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are just huge balls of gas pretending to be planets.</p>
<p>Certain moons of Jupiter and Saturn are possibly habitable, but they&#8217;re farther away and colder and darker than Mars, so why would we do that.</p>
<p>Pluto is even farther and colder and darker. Stop asking me about Pluto.</p>
<p>That leaves Mars. Mars isn&#8217;t a good time. If Mars were a place on Earth, it&#8217;s somewhere no one would want to go. But compared to all of those other options, it&#8217;s a dream. It&#8217;s cold but not that cold. It&#8217;s kind of dark but not that much darker than Earth. It&#8217;s far but not that far. Its day is almost the same length as ours, which is nice for us and hugely helpful for growing Earthly vegetation. Its surface gravity isn&#8217;t crazy low or crazy high (it&#8217;s around a third of Earth&#8217;s). It has a ton of (frozen) water and a decent amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, which are critical for early attempts at living there and hugely helpful for future attempts to &#8220;terraform&#8221; the planet into a place more livable for humans. All things considered, we&#8217;re very lucky to have an option as good as Mars—in most other solar systems, we probably wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why 1,000,000 people?</strong></span></p>
<p>Because Elon thinks that&#8217;s a rough estimate for the number of people you&#8217;d need to have on Mars in order for the Mars civilization to be &#8220;self-sustaining&#8221;—with self-sustaining defined by Elon as: &#8220;Even if the spaceships from Earth permanently stop coming, the colony doesn’t eventually die out—which requires a huge industrial base, and a much harder industrial base to create than being on Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, if hard drive #2 relies on hard drive #1 in order to stay working, then your photo album isn&#8217;t really backed up, is it? The whole point of hard drive #2 is to save the day if hard drive #1 permanently crashes.</p>
<p>And while the Earth hard drive could &#8220;crash&#8221; for many exciting reasons—an asteroid hits us, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI kills us</a>, Trump kills us, ISIS creates some upsetting biological weapon, etc.—Elon also warns about the less dramatic possibility that the Earth ships stop coming simply because Earth civilization stops having the capability to send them:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The spaceships from Earth could stop coming for other reasons—it could be WWIII, it could be that Earth becomes a religious state, it could be some gradual decline where Earth civilization just sinks under its own weight. </em><em>At one point the Egyptians were able to build pyramids, and then they forgot how to do that. And then they forgot how to read hieroglyphics, until the Rosetta Stone. Rome as well—they had indoor plumbing, they had advanced aqueducts, and then that fell apart. China at one point had the world’s biggest fleet of sailing ships and they were sailing as far as Africa, then some crazy emperor came along and decided that was bad and had them all burnt. So you just don’t know what’s gonna happen. The key threshold to pass is the number of people and tons of cargo required to make things self-sustaining. And that’s probably something like a million people and probably something like 10-100 million tons of cargo.</em></p>
<p class="p1">In other words, let&#8217;s not wait on this.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Great, but how the hell do you bring 1,000,000 people to Mars?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">You make this green part exist:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5721" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3.png" alt="Blue circle: People who can afford to go to Mars.

<p class="p1">It&#8217;s kind of simple. If we get to a point where there are a million people on Earth who both want to go to Mars <em>and</em> can afford to go to Mars, there will be a million people on Mars.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, right now the yellow circle is tiny and the blue circle doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon thinks—and I kind of do too—that if the blue circle can get big enough, the yellow circle will take care of itself. If Mars is affordable and safe and you know you&#8217;ll be able to come back, a lot of people will want to go.</p>
<p class="p1">The hard part is the blue circle. Here&#8217;s the issue:</p>
<p class="p1">Last time the US Congress checked with NASA, the cost to send a five-person crew to Mars was $50 billion. $10 billion a person. Elon thinks that to make the blue circle sufficiently large, it needs to cost $500,000 a person. 1/20,000 of the current cost.</p>
<p class="p1">1/20,000.</p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s like looking at the car industry and saying, &#8220;Right now a new Honda costs around $20,000. To make this a viable industry, we need to get the cost of a new car down to $1.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So what the hell?</p>
<p class="p1">Here&#8217;s the hell:</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine if the way planes worked was that they took off, flew to their destination, but then instead of landing, all the passengers parachuted down to the ground and then the plane landed by smashing into the ocean and blowing up. So every plane flew exactly once, and to have a new flight happen, you&#8217;d have to build another plane.</p>
<p class="p1">A plane ticket would cost $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="p1">Space travel is currently so expensive mostly because we land rockets by crashing them into the ocean (or incinerating them in the atmosphere).</p>
<p class="p1">When Elon started SpaceX, he was determined to fix this problem. It was a tall order, given that no one had ever done it before—including nations like the US and Russia who had spent billions trying. But SpaceX puzzled away at the problem year after year, and after trying and failing a bunch of times, in late 2015, they nailed it:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMFZN3FyNlk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Then they nailed it again. And again. And again. Now they nail it more often than not. Here&#8217;s a daytime view of a recent landing:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPGUQySBikQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Soon, for the first time, a previously used-and-landed, flight-tested Falcon 9 will carry out a new mission for SpaceX, officially making SpaceX rockets &#8220;reusable.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">To fly a mission on a used rocket, you only need to pay for propellant (fuel and liquid oxygen) and a bit of routine maintenance. This cuts the price of space travel down by 100 or even 1,000 times.</p>
<p class="p1">That leaves us with somewhere between 19/20 and 199/200 of the cost left to cut. Part of that will happen when SpaceX takes 100 or more people to Mars at a time, instead of five (the number Congress asked NASA about). The rest of it is taken care of by a few simple innovations, like refueling the spaceships in orbit (which lowers the cost by 5-10x) and manufacturing propellant on Mars so you don&#8217;t have to carry your return propellant with you (which lowers the cost by another 5-10x). More on those things later.</p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly, not only can the price get down to $500,000/ticket, it can probably go even lower (Elon thinks it could eventually cost under $100,000/person). You may not have noticed it yet, but SpaceX&#8217;s innovations are in the process of creating a total revolution in the cost of space travel—a change that will open doors we can&#8217;t imagine being open today. And when that revolution goes far enough, SpaceX&#8217;s vision of putting 1,000,000 people on Mars really—actually—seriously—may happen.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re going to Mars. And this week, SpaceX showed us the thing that&#8217;s gonna take us there.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 22pt;"><strong>The Rocket</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It’s so mind-blowing. It blows my mind, and I see it every week.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Elon&#8217;s pumped. And when you learn about the big fucking rocket he&#8217;s building, you&#8217;ll understand why.</p>
<p class="p1">First, let&#8217;s absorb the challenge at hand. It&#8217;s often said that space is hard. To this day, only a few hundred people have been in space, only a few countries have the ability to launch something into space, and the history of human space travel is littered with tragic launch failures. Firing something super heavy and delicate and full of explosive liquid up through the atmosphere without anything going wrong is incredibly hard.</p>
<p class="p1">But when we talk about humans going into space, we&#8217;re talking mostly about humans going into Low Earth Orbit, a layer of space between 100 and 1,200 miles above the ground—and normally, they&#8217;re headed only 250 miles up to the International Space Station. The only time humans have gone farther were the small handful of Americans who made it out to the moon in the 1960s, traveling about 250,000 miles away.</p>
<p class="p1">When Earth and Mars are at their closest, Mars is somewhere between 34 and 60 million miles away—about 200 times farther away than the moon and about 200,000 times farther away than the ISS.</p>
<p class="p1">The moon is just over one light second away.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5722" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second.png" alt="distance diagram of Earth and the moon with a bar representing 1 light second that nearly reaches the moon" width="829" height="160" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second.png 8499w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second-300x58.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second-768x149.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second-600x116.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Mars is more than three light <em>minutes </em>away.</p>
<p class="p1">Mars is far.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon likes to compare the Earth-to-Mars trip to crossing the Atlantic Ocean, noting that using that scale, going to the moon would only be crossing the English Channel (and going to the ISS would be going to a dock 117 feet off the shore). Continuing with that comparison, he says, &#8220;A rocket made to go to Low Earth Orbit or even the moon is basically like a coastal fishing vessel, compared to a colonial transport system that is trying to go 1,000 times further.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">On top of that, it might be worth it to take only a few humans or a single satellite up into Low Earth Orbit—but if you&#8217;re going all the way to Mars, you want to take a <em>lot </em>more than that. So you have to take much more mass, much further. Multiplying the distance factor by the payload factor, Elon explains that a Mars transport system &#8220;is like literally a million times more capable than what the current world launch system can do. It has to be.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">It also has to be incredibly advanced. Elon says, &#8220;It’s not just bigger, it needs to be more efficient. There&#8217;s a false dichotomy when it comes to rockets of &#8216;small and complex&#8217; or &#8216;big and dumb.&#8217; People talk about the &#8216;big dumb booster&#8217;—that won&#8217;t work. You need a big smart booster. If you want to build a Mars colony, you have no choice— you have to make it big and efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So that&#8217;s all you have to do—build a rocket that&#8217;s a million times more capable than today&#8217;s best rockets but who&#8217;s also efficient and smart and great in bed.</p>

<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a <em>skyscraper</em>. Or as Elon puts it, &#8220;by far the biggest flying object ever.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">In yesterday&#8217;s presentation, Elon explained that this isn&#8217;t a first crack at how it might look, or an artist&#8217;s impression of how it might look—it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to look. This is the thing they&#8217;re building.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, SpaceX seems to be going through an existential crisis when it comes to naming this thing—first it was the Mars Colonial Transporter, then (because it can go <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/776939304140414976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">way past Mars</a>) it was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/777325549442232320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renamed</a> the Interplanetary Transport System, then yesterday in the presentation, Elon said they haven&#8217;t actually settled on a name yet but that the specific spaceship that makes the maiden voyage to Mars might be called Heart of Gold<a href="#footnote-1-5715" id="note-1-5715" rel="footnote">1</a>—so no one knows what to call it.</p>
<p class="p1">Which is why—until I hear otherwise—I&#8217;ll be calling it something I once heard Elon describe it as in an interview: the Big Fucking Rocket (BFR).</p>
<p class="p1">The Big Fucking Rocket is fucking big. At 400 feet tall, it&#8217;s the height of a 40-story skyscraper. At 40 feet in diameter, a school bus could fit entirely underneath its footprint. It&#8217;s more than three times the mass and generates over three times the thrust of the gargantuan <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/s/satvb.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saturn V</a>—the rocket used in the Apollo mission—which currently stands as by far the biggest rocket humanity has made.</p>
<p class="p1">Here&#8217;s how it stacks up next to a bunch of other rockets in size:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5760" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-1.png" alt="rocket-lineup" width="900" height="256" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-1.png 1569w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-1-300x85.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-1-768x218.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-1-600x171.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The difference is even more extreme when you compare the rockets by how many kilograms of payload (i.e. cargo and/or people) they can each take to orbit:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5761 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2.png" alt="rocket-lineup-2" width="1369" height="369" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2.png 1369w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2-300x81.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2-768x207.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2-600x162.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1369px) 100vw, 1369px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">For comparison, SpaceX&#8217;s badass <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Falcon 9</a> rocket will be able to take about 4 tons of payload to Mars, and the <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Falcon Heavy</a>—which is about to be today&#8217;s most powerful rocket—will be able to take about 13 tons to Mars. Elon believes the BFR will be able to take a few <em>hundred </em>tons of payload to Mars at first and eventually be able to take <em>1,000 </em>tons. The absurdity of that statistic—that the behemoth Falcon Heavy can only manage a little over 1% of the BFR&#8217;s ultimate Mars payload—is pretty hard to absorb.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, to be clear—what I&#8217;ve been calling the Big Fucking Rocket this whole time is actually two things: a Big Fucking Spaceship sitting on top of a Big Fucking Booster.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5762" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2.png" alt="diagram of spacex mars rocket. spaceship: crew cabin, cargo cabin, liquid oxygen tank, methane fuel tank, 9 Raptor engines. booster: liquid oxygen tank, methane fuel tank, 42 Raptor engines" width="785" height="680" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2.png 1096w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2-300x260.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2-768x665.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2-600x520.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Big Fucking Booster</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s start by talking about the booster. The 25-story-high booster—AKA the actual rocket of the BFR—is what Elon calls &#8220;quite a beast.&#8221; It&#8217;s the biggest booster of all time—by <em>far</em>. By physical size, definitely, but even more so by thrust.</p>
<p class="p1">In the SpaceX post, I <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked about</a> the Falcon 9&#8217;s nine <a href="http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/03/26/merlin-engines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merlin engines</a>, and how each one was powerful enough to lift a stack of 40 cars up into the sky—in total, that meant the Falcon 9 set of engines could lift 360 cars. The Falcon Heavy, with its 27 Merlin engines, could lift a stack of over 1,000 cars up past the clouds.<a href="#footnote-2-5715" id="note-2-5715" rel="footnote">2</a>
<p class="p1">The Big Fucking Booster sits atop a different kind of engine: the Raptor.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5726" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor.jpg" alt="spacex raptor engine" width="400" height="642" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor.jpg 2460w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor-187x300.jpg 187w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor-768x1233.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor-374x600.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The Raptor engine looks a lot like a Merlin, with one key difference—by significantly increasing the pressure, SpaceX has made the Raptor over three times more powerful than a Merlin.</p>
<p class="p1">A single Raptor engine produces <em>310 tons</em> of thrust—enough to lift 310 tons, or a stack of 172 cars, or <em>an entire Boeing 747 airplane</em>, into the sky. That&#8217;s what <em>one </em>Raptor can do.<a href="#footnote-3-5715" id="note-3-5715" rel="footnote">3</a>
<p class="p1">And the BFB has <em>42 of them</em>.<a href="#footnote-4-5715" id="note-4-5715" rel="footnote">4</a>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5727" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors.jpg" alt="view of 42 Raptor engines" width="450" height="420" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors.jpg 3170w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors-300x280.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors-768x717.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors-600x560.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">All together, that&#8217;s an unheard of 13,033 tons of thrust, enough to push more than 7,000 cars—or <em>50 </em>large airplanes—up to space.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Big Fucking Spaceship</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">So then there&#8217;s the spacecraft—which SpaceX calls the Interplanetary Spaceship, and which I&#8217;m going to keep calling the Big Fucking Spaceship because it&#8217;s more fun. The BFS is the big cool-looking thing on top of the BFB (in case you&#8217;re getting Big Fucking Confused—the Big Fucking Spaceship (BFS) on top of the Big Fucking Booster (BFB) together make what I&#8217;ve been calling the Big Fucking Rocket (BFR)). The BFS is what will take the people and cargo to Mars. It&#8217;s also what will launch, on its own, off Mars and return to Earth with people who want to come back.</p>
<p class="p1">The BFS is itself the size of a tall, 16-story building, and is 55 feet wide at its thickest point. In addition to hundreds, and eventually a thousand tons of cargo, the BFS will be able to carry as many as 100 people at the beginning, and Elon believes that number could grow to 200 and even above 300 people over time—like a cruise ship.</p>
<p class="p1">With nine Raptor engines, it&#8217;ll have more liftoff thrust on its own than any of today&#8217;s rockets—including next year&#8217;s Falcon Heavy. For a second-stage, cargo-carrying spacecraft to pack more thrust than even the most powerful first-stage rockets is outrageous.</p>
<p class="p1">Here&#8217;s a cross-section up close:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5751" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section.jpg" alt="cross section of spacex mars spacecraft" width="414" height="1060" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section.jpg 1653w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section-117x300.jpg 117w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section-768x1966.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section-234x600.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I asked Elon what it&#8217;ll be like to ride in it. He said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;d be in a giant spaceship in microgravity.<a href="#footnote-5-5715" id="note-5-5715" rel="footnote">5</a> I mean, it would be pretty fun. You&#8217;d be floating around.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Good point.</p>
<p class="p1">In the presentation Q&amp;A, he added: &#8220;It has to be really fun and exciting, it can&#8217;t feel cramped or boring. The crew compartment is set up so that you can do zero-g games, you can float around, there will be movies, lecture halls, cabins, a restaurant—it&#8217;ll be really fun to go.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Um, yeah, get me on that shit now. <em>A zero gravity cruise ship</em>. With this view:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5765" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1.png" alt="observatory_f_hd_3-1" width="850" height="425" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1.png 1297w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1-300x150.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1-768x384.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And if you were to go, here&#8217;s how the whole thing would work:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>1) Get on the ship. </strong>The BFR will be taking off from pad 39A at Cape Canaveral, Florida—the same pad that the Apollo astronauts left from. This is because that pad was built to be absurdly large since they didn&#8217;t know yet how big a rocket they&#8217;d be using. When you get there, you head up the tower and across the bridge into the Big Fucking Spaceship.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5729" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge.jpg" alt="air-bridge" width="900" height="448" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge.jpg 2183w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge-300x149.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge-768x382.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>2) Take off. </strong>You strap in, and the BFR lifts off. After a few minutes, the first-stage BFB separates and heads back down to Earth. The BFS that you&#8217;re in continues onward and settles into Earth&#8217;s orbit.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5731" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o.jpg" alt="29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o" width="852" height="363" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o.jpg 1920w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o-300x128.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o-768x327.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>3) Refuel in orbit. </strong>After landing back on Earth, the BFB is capped with a new BFS—this one full of propellant (liquid oxygen and methane).<a href="#footnote-6-5715" id="note-6-5715" rel="footnote">6</a> It lifts off again and pings the propellant-filled spaceship into orbit, where it rendezvouses<a href="#footnote-7-5715" id="note-7-5715" rel="footnote">7</a> with your spaceship. The two connect like two orcas holding hands as the propellant is transferred.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5732" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h.jpg" alt="29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h" width="850" height="362" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h.jpg 1600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h-300x128.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h-768x327.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This happens a few more times until your spaceship is entirely refueled.<a href="#footnote-8-5715" id="note-8-5715" rel="footnote">8</a> This process is critical A) for lowering the cost of the trip, and B) for making the trip much faster. People have always thought a journey to Mars would take six or nine months, but the BFS will get there in three.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>6) Land on Mars. </strong>Upright, the same way the first stage lands on Earth.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>7) Live on Mars for a while doing god knows what. </strong>If it&#8217;s early on in the colonization process, you&#8217;re probably there to work and help build up the initial industries. Later on, it could be anything—research, entrepreneurship, or just simply adventure.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>8) Make propellant on Mars. </strong>This will be one of the key early industries to set up on Mars. Propellant consists of liquid oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which are both conveniently easy to make from the massive quantities of H<sub>2</sub>O (ice) and CO<sub>2 </sub>(the main gas in the Martian atmosphere) already sitting on Mars. They&#8217;ll use this propellant to load up the spaceship you came there on in preparation for its voyage back to Earth. Doing this spares the massive expense of having to carry propellant all the way from Earth for the return trip.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>9) Either stay forever or come back. </strong>If you come back, you&#8217;ll do so by boarding one of the BFS&#8217;s that came over in the last batch.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>10) Land vertically on Earth. </strong>Just like you did on Mars. The spaceship will go through routine maintenance in preparation to head back to Mars two years later.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>11) Be that insufferable person who can&#8217;t be part of any conversation without figuring out some way to bring up your time on Mars. </strong></p>

<p class="p1">So that&#8217;s the deal with the Big Fucking Rocket and how it&#8217;ll all work.<a href="#footnote-10-5715" id="note-10-5715" rel="footnote">10</a>
<p class="p1">Now let&#8217;s talk about how this all might play out.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 22pt;"><strong>The Plan</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Back to reality. So how do we get from, &#8220;there&#8217;s this rad potential rocket that might be ready to launch in five years&#8221; to &#8220;we&#8217;re a thriving multi-planetary civilization with a million people on Mars&#8221;?</p>
<p class="p1">10,000 flights. That&#8217;s how many BFS trips to Mars Elon thinks it&#8217;ll take to bring the Mars population to a million.</p>
<p class="p1">Why 10,000? Because there will be at least 100 people on most trips, and that number will go up over time—but there will also be some people coming back from Mars each time other people go. In the lower part of each BFS will be a huge cargo compartment. Elon thinks we&#8217;ll need to get at least 10 million tons of cargo to Mars for the million-person colony to become self-sustaining, which will happen in a little over 10,000 flights if SpaceX can get the cargo payload capacity up to 1,000 tons relatively quickly, as they hope to.</p>
<p class="p1">And when will these 10,000 trips start?</p>
<p class="p1">Well let&#8217;s take a look at the Mars-Earth Synodic calendar—which deals with the dates when Earth and Mars are closest to each other (called a &#8220;Mars opposition&#8221;). Earth&#8217;s orbit is smaller than Mars&#8217;s, so Earth goes around the sun quicker—so much so that every 26 months, Earth laps Mars and they&#8217;re briefly next to each other. That&#8217;s the one time when Earth-Mars transfers can happen.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re currently pretty close to Mars, since the last Mars opposition happened on May 22, 2016. That&#8217;s why, if you happen to be an &#8220;oh shit there&#8217;s a way-too-bright star let me take out my Sky Guide app and figure out which planet that is and then tell everyone I&#8217;m with and find that, yet again, no one cares, because everyone is a horrible person&#8221; nerd like me, you know that all summer, Mars has been super prominent and bright in our night sky.<a href="#footnote-11-5715" id="note-11-5715" rel="footnote">11</a> A year from now, Mars will be on the other side of the sun from us, and we won&#8217;t see it in our night sky at all.</p>
<p class="p1">The 2016 Earth-Mars opposition is also a special one, because it&#8217;s the last time it&#8217;ll happen without anybody talking about it.</p>
<p class="p1">Why? Because starting with the next one in July of 2018, SpaceX will start sending stuff to Mars each time there&#8217;s an opposition, and this will become increasingly big news each time. Here&#8217;s the tentative schedule, if everything goes perfectly to plan:</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Upcoming Mars Oppositions</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">– and what SpaceX is planning for each</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>July, 2018: </strong>Send a <a href="http://www.spacex.com/dragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon</a> spacecraft (the Falcon 9&#8217;s SUV-size spacecraft) to Mars with cargo</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>October, 2020: </strong>Send multiple Dragons with more cargo</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>December, 2022: </strong>Maiden BFS voyage to Mars. Carrying only cargo. This is the spaceship Elon wants to call Heart of Gold.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>January, 2025: </strong>First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s all go back and read that last line again.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>January, 2025: </strong>First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Did you catch that?</p>
<p class="p1">If things go to plan,<em> the Neil Armstrong of Mars will touch down about eight years from now.</em></p>
<p class="p1">And zero people are talking about it.</p>
<p class="p1">But they will be. The hype will start a couple years from now when the Dragons make their Mars trips, and it&#8217;ll kick into high gear in 2022 when the Big Fucking Spaceship finally launches and heads to Mars and lands there. Everyone will be talking about this.</p>
<p class="p1">And the buzz will just accelerate from there as the first group of BFS astronauts are announced and become household names, admired for their bravery, because everyone will know there&#8217;s a reasonable chance something goes wrong and they don&#8217;t make it back alive. Then, in 2024 they&#8217;ll take off on a three-month trip that&#8217;ll be front-page news every day. When they land, everyone on Earth will be watching. It&#8217;ll be 1969 all over again.</p>
<p class="p1">This is a thing that&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon doesn&#8217;t like when people ask him about this first voyage and the Neil Armstrong of Mars. He says that it&#8217;s not about humanity putting a new multi-planetary feather in its cap, and he&#8217;s quick to point out, &#8220;putting people on the moon was super exciting—but where&#8217;s our moon base?&#8221; In other words, having humanity give Mars a high five for bragging rights is not what matters—what matters is carrying out the full vision of actually creating a full, self-sustaining civilization on Mars.</p>
<p class="p1">And yeah, sure, fine. But <em>I&#8217;m excited for 2025</em>. It&#8217;s gonna be so fun.</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, so then the next Mars opposition will roll around in 2027. This time, if everything stays on track, multiple BFS&#8217;s will make the trek to Mars, carrying more people than were in the original group in 2025. And the spaceship that went over in 2025—the space Mayflower<em>—</em>will make its return trip to Earth, carrying some of the first group of Mars pioneers back home. They&#8217;ll return to massive celebration as international heroes, and the legendary spaceship will head off to enjoy its life in the Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p class="p1">Meanwhile, we&#8217;ll all be glued to the TV<a href="#footnote-12-5715" id="note-12-5715" rel="footnote">12</a> as the group of BFS&#8217;s arrive on Mars, where the people in them will continue the grueling work started by the 2025 group. The early colonists will have a hard job like early colonists always do—and this will be extra hard. Not only will they have to truly start from scratch—digging mines and quarries and refineries, constructing the first underground village habitat with the first Martian hospitals and schools and greenhouse farms, laying down a giant plumbing system to pump water into the village, building that first rocket propellant plant—but they&#8217;ll have to do all of this in a place where they can&#8217;t go outside without a spacesuit on, and where everyone and everything they&#8217;ve ever known is on a pale blue dot in the night sky.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;ll be hard, but for the explorers of our world the payoff may be worth it. Elon says: &#8220;You can go anywhere on Earth in 24 hours. There&#8217;s no physical frontier on Earth anymore. Now, space is that frontier, so it’ll appeal to anyone with that exploratory spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">In April of 2029, SpaceX will send an even larger group of spacecraft, people, and cargo to Mars. This time, it&#8217;ll probably get less attention. By 2029, we&#8217;ll probably be getting used to the idea that there are people on Mars and that every 26 months, a great two-way migration occurs.</p>
<p class="p1">The growing Mars colony will continue to entice the adventurers—those who read about the great sailing exhibitions of the 15th and 16th centuries and yearn to be there. When I asked Elon about how the small colony will grow and evolve, he said: &#8220;Think of the Mars colony as an organism that starts off as a zygote, and then becomes multi-cellular, and then gets organ differentiation—so it doesn’t look exactly the same all the way along, any more than the first settlement in Jamestown wasn’t representative of the United States today. It’ll be the same with Mars—Mars will be the new New World.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The 2031 and 2033 and 2035 oppositions will bring substantially more people to the new New World. By this point, the budding Martian city will be a part of our lives. We&#8217;ll follow the Twitter feeds of some of our favorite journalists on Mars to keep up with what&#8217;s happening there. We&#8217;ll all get hooked on Mars&#8217;s first hit reality shows. And some of us will start thinking, &#8220;Should I sign up to go to Mars one of these years before I get too old?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">By 2050, there will be over a hundred thousand people on Mars. The company your son works for might have a branch there, and he&#8217;ll be saying goodbye to a couple co-workers who are about to head to the planet for a 52-month stint. He tells you that he doesn&#8217;t want to go because he doesn&#8217;t want to take his ninth-grade daughter away from her life and her friends. But he says she&#8217;s applying to a program that would bring her to Mars from the ages of 17 to 23 for an urban planning degree. You worry, even though you know it&#8217;s irrational. It&#8217;s just that you remember the days when going to Mars was risky and dangerous, and some part of you is still uncomfortable with it. And what if she decides not to come back?</p>
<p class="p1">By 2065, the early days of Mars seem primitive. During the first few Mars migrations, only a few spaceships made the trip with only 100 people in each, it was prohibitively expensive to go, it took three months to get there, and there were only a few very grueling industries on Mars to work in.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2065, every Mars opposition sees over 1,000 ships make the trip, each carrying over 500 people and a couple thousand tons of cargo. Half a million people make the journey every two years, and about 50,000 less than that come back, because Earth-to-Mars migration capacity grows a little bit each time as more ships are built. The trip, which now takes only 30 days, costs only $60,000 (in 2016 dollars)—and most people just pay off the ticket price with their well-paying job on Mars (labor is in high demand as the early Mars cities continue to expand and new cities are built).</p>
<p class="p1">Many people remember those early days of the Mars colony when it was all about SpaceX—funded by SpaceX or their cargo clients and driven by their ambition and their ingenuity and their guts. But now, dozens of companies specialize in Earth-Mars transit and hundreds of companies focus on development and entrepreneurship on Mars. And transit is paid for like planes and trains and buses are paid for today—by passengers buying tickets.</p>
<p class="p1">A decade later, the 2074 migration brings the Mars population above a million people. Small celebrations break out around both worlds, as a long-awaited landmark is achieved. Most people though, don&#8217;t even notice.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p class="p1">Everything I just said was based on things Elon said on my phone call with him. Some of it was numbers he said directly—like the last paragraph, which came from him saying, “I’m hopeful that we can get to a million roughly 50 years after the start.” Other times it was me extrapolating a possible future, given the predictions I heard from him. It&#8217;s all based in reality. At least, it&#8217;s based in Elon Musk&#8217;s best crack at reality. He was very careful to qualify everything that sounded like a prediction or a projection with, &#8220;This is what <em>might </em>happen <em>if</em> things go well—but there&#8217;s no way to know, and many things could go wrong along the way.&#8221; He emphasized that &#8220;it&#8217;s not that SpaceX has all the answers and we&#8217;ve got it covered or anything like that—it&#8217;s that we want to show that it&#8217;s possible. But it&#8217;s far from a given.&#8221; As for things that could go wrong, he listed off a few (like World War III), and one of his biggest concerns is that if he somehow dies young, SpaceX could be taken over by someone who wants to milk the company for profit instead of staying single-mindedly focused on the Mars civilization mission.</p>
<p class="p1">But if SpaceX can manage to get this thing started, Elon thinks it could be not just a big deal in itself, it could jumpstart a slew of new possibilities for humanity. He explains:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The big picture isn&#8217;t just to back up the hard drive but to really change humanity into a multi-planetary species. Essentially what we’re saying is we’re establishing a regular cargo route to Mars. With the economic forcing function of interplanetary commerce, there will be the resources and the incentive to massively improve space transport technology, and I think then things really go to a whole new level. </em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>What I’m describing may sound really crazy, but it actually will be a small fraction of what is ultimately done, as long as we become a two-planet civilization. Look at shipping technology in Europe. When all you had to do was cross the Mediterranean, the ships were pretty lame—they couldn’t cross the Atlantic. So commerce basically had short-range vessels. Without the forcing function, shipping technology didn’t improve that much—you could do the same things with ships, pretty much, around the time of Julius Caesar as you could around the time of Columbus. 1,500 years later, you could still just cross the Mediterranean. But as soon as there was a reason to cross the Atlantic, shipping technology improved dramatically. There needed to be the American colonies in order for that to happen.</em></p>
<p class="p1">The people at SpaceX believe that once we&#8217;re on Mars, the rest of the Solar System becomes accessible as well. That&#8217;s why they didn&#8217;t just create images of their Big Fucking Rocket standing proudly on Mars. They showed it flying by Jupiter.</p>

In the book, Heart of Gold was &#8220;the first spacecraft to make use of the Infinite Improbability.&#8221; Elon likes the name because he thinks SpaceX&#8217;s path was highly improbable.<a href="#note-1-5715" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-1.footnote--><li id="footnote-2-5715" class="footnote"><p>To be clear, <em>payload</em> is what the rocket can actually bring to space. <em>Thrust </em>is what the engines can <em>push</em> to space, which has to include both the entire BFR and its contained payload. Almost all of a rocket&#8217;s thrust is used to lift the rocket itself, with only a small fraction of it allotted for the payload. When I talk about thrust in these posts and say how many cars a set of engines could push to space, I&#8217;m talking about a hypothetical scenario in which there is no rocket, just the rocket&#8217;s engines with a platform on top of them and cars stacked on top of the platform.<a href="#note-2-5715" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-2.footnote--><li id="footnote-3-5715" class="footnote"><p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7kqFt3nID4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> of Raptor&#8217;s first test firing, which happened a few days ago. It would be so unfun to put your hand through that column of flame.<a href="#note-3-5715" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-3.footnote--><li id="footnote-4-5715" class="footnote"><p>I asked Elon why there were 42 smaller-sized engines instead of a smaller number of huge ones, and he said that they had imagined larger engines at one point but that &#8220;optimization seems to call for more small engines, not fewer big engines.&#8221; I can&#8217;t explain more than that because I don&#8217;t get it.<a href="#note-4-5715" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-4.footnote--><li id="footnote-5-5715" class="footnote"><p>We often think of floating astronauts as being in &#8220;zero gravity.&#8221; In fact, they&#8217;re very much inside of the Earth&#8217;s gravity well when they&#8217;re floating—they&#8217;re just orbiting around the Earth so fast that they&#8217;re in constant free fall. The effect is the same—they float—but since they&#8217;re not actually in zero gravity, we call it microgravity.<a href="#note-5-5715" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-5.footnote--><li id="footnote-6-5715" class="footnote"><p>The methane part of that is a big innovation.

If it takes a lot longer, then the spacecraft will be launched first without people, and then whenever it&#8217;s all refueled and ready to go, a spacecraft carrying just people will be launched and it will deliver the crew to the spacecraft for an Earth orbit rendezvous.<a href="#note-8-5715" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-8.footnote--><li id="footnote-9-5715" class="footnote"><p>People like to bring up the dangers of space radiation during this time. Elon thinks the dangers are overstated, and that with proper precautions (like a protective layer of water around the crew cabin), the radiation harm to a crew member would be similar to the damage to your body if you were to become a smoker during those three months and then stop. Not ideal, but not too big a deal.<a href="#note-9-5715" class="footnote-return">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-9.footnote--><li id="footnote-10-5715" class="footnote"><p>In the presentation, Elon went off on a tangent at one point that delighted me. He talked about the possibility of the BFR&#8217;s spaceship doubling as a super-fast way to transport stuff or people around the Earth: &#8220;It actually has enough capability that you could maybe even go to orbit with the spaceship&#8230;and maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world&#8230;We could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45 minutes at the longest—most would be maybe 20, 25 minutes. So maybe if we had a floating platform off the coast of New York, you could go from New York to Tokyo in 25 minutes. You could cross the Atlantic in 10 minutes. Most of your time would be getting to the ship, and then it would be real quick after that. There are some intriguing possibilities there, but we’re not counting on that.&#8221; YES. Amazing glimpse of the world of the future, when someone will text you from Delhi and ask if you want to zip over from San Francisco to grab lunch, and you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Sure, but I have a meeting in two hours, so I can&#8217;t stay long.&#8221; Except you won&#8217;t, because you&#8217;ll just meet your friend virtually and it&#8217;ll feel exactly how it would to be there in person.

<p>Yesterday, Elon Musk got on stage at the 2016 International Astronautical Congress and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8" target="_blank">unveiled the first real details</a> about the big freaking rocket they&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>A couple months ago, when SpaceX first announced that this would be happening in late September, it hit me that I might still have special privileges with them, kind of grandfathered in from my time working with Elon and his companies in 2015 (which resulted in <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html" target="_blank">an in-depth four-part blog series</a>). So I reached out and asked if I could learn about the big freaking rocket ahead of time and write a post about it.</p>
<p>They said yes.</p>
<p>A little while later, I got on a call with Elon to discuss the rocket, the timeline, and the big plan this was all a part of. We started off how we always do.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Call-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5744" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Call-1.jpg" alt="(on the phone) Tim: You're Elon Musk.

<p>Eventually, we were able to settle in to a fascinating conversation about this insane machine SpaceX is building and what&#8217;s going to happen with it.</p>
<p>Now, before we get into things—</p>
<p>This post is only a piece of The SpaceX Story—one of the most amazing stories of our time—and a story I spent three months and 40,000 words telling last year.

<p>For those who have read the post and want a refresher or those who just want to hear about the big freaking rocket and move on with their day, here&#8217;s a quick overview of the background:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 22pt;"><strong>The Context</strong></span></p>
<p>To understand why the big freaking rocket matters, you have to understand this sentence:</p>
<p><em>SpaceX is trying to make human life multi-planetary by building a self-sustaining, one-million-person civilization on Mars.</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go part by part.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why make human life multi-planetary?</strong></span></p>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1) It&#8217;s fun and exciting.</strong> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/waitbutwhy/2-reasons-to-go-to-mars" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a clip</a> from one of the interviews I did with Elon last year where he articulates this point.)</p>
<p><strong>2) It&#8217;s not a great idea to have all of our eggs in one basket. </strong>Right now we&#8217;re all on Earth, which means that if something terrible happens on Earth—caused by nature or by our own technology—we&#8217;re done. That&#8217;s like having a precious digital photo album saved only on one not-necessarily-reliable hard drive. If you were in that situation, you&#8217;d be smart to back the album up on a second hard drive. That&#8217;s the idea here. Elon calls it &#8220;life insurance for the species.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why Mars?</strong></span></p>
<p>Venus is a jerk, with its lead-melting temperatures, its crushing atmospheric pressure, and its unbearable winds.</p>
<p>The moon has few natural resources, a 28-day day, and with no atmosphere to either provide protection against the sun during the day or warm things up at night, both day and night become murderous. Same deal on Mercury.</p>
<p>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are just huge balls of gas pretending to be planets.</p>
<p>Certain moons of Jupiter and Saturn are possibly habitable, but they&#8217;re farther away and colder and darker than Mars, so why would we do that.</p>
<p>Pluto is even farther and colder and darker. Stop asking me about Pluto.</p>
<p>That leaves Mars. Mars isn&#8217;t a good time. If Mars were a place on Earth, it&#8217;s somewhere no one would want to go. But compared to all of those other options, it&#8217;s a dream. It&#8217;s cold but not that cold. It&#8217;s kind of dark but not that much darker than Earth. It&#8217;s far but not that far. Its day is almost the same length as ours, which is nice for us and hugely helpful for growing Earthly vegetation. Its surface gravity isn&#8217;t crazy low or crazy high (it&#8217;s around a third of Earth&#8217;s). It has a ton of (frozen) water and a decent amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, which are critical for early attempts at living there and hugely helpful for future attempts to &#8220;terraform&#8221; the planet into a place more livable for humans. All things considered, we&#8217;re very lucky to have an option as good as Mars—in most other solar systems, we probably wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why 1,000,000 people?</strong></span></p>
<p>Because Elon thinks that&#8217;s a rough estimate for the number of people you&#8217;d need to have on Mars in order for the Mars civilization to be &#8220;self-sustaining&#8221;—with self-sustaining defined by Elon as: &#8220;Even if the spaceships from Earth permanently stop coming, the colony doesn’t eventually die out—which requires a huge industrial base, and a much harder industrial base to create than being on Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, if hard drive #2 relies on hard drive #1 in order to stay working, then your photo album isn&#8217;t really backed up, is it? The whole point of hard drive #2 is to save the day if hard drive #1 permanently crashes.</p>
<p>And while the Earth hard drive could &#8220;crash&#8221; for many exciting reasons—an asteroid hits us, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank">AI kills us</a>, Trump kills us, ISIS creates some upsetting biological weapon, etc.—Elon also warns about the less dramatic possibility that the Earth ships stop coming simply because Earth civilization stops having the capability to send them:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The spaceships from Earth could stop coming for other reasons—it could be WWIII, it could be that Earth becomes a religious state, it could be some gradual decline where Earth civilization just sinks under its own weight. </em><em>At one point the Egyptians were able to build pyramids, and then they forgot how to do that. And then they forgot how to read hieroglyphics, until the Rosetta Stone. Rome as well—they had indoor plumbing, they had advanced aqueducts, and then that fell apart. China at one point had the world’s biggest fleet of sailing ships and they were sailing as far as Africa, then some crazy emperor came along and decided that was bad and had them all burnt. So you just don’t know what’s gonna happen. The key threshold to pass is the number of people and tons of cargo required to make things self-sustaining. And that’s probably something like a million people and probably something like 10-100 million tons of cargo.</em></p>
<p class="p1">In other words, let&#8217;s not wait on this.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Great, but how the heck do you bring 1,000,000 people to Mars?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">You make this green part exist:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5721" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3.png" alt="Blue circle: People who can afford to go to Mars. Yellow circle: People who want to go to Mars. Green intersection: At least a million people" width="604" height="354" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3.png 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3-300x176.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3-768x451.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn3-600x352.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s kind of simple. If we get to a point where there are a million people on Earth who both want to go to Mars <em>and</em> can afford to go to Mars, there will be a million people on Mars.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, right now the yellow circle is tiny and the blue circle doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon thinks—and I kind of do too—that if the blue circle can get big enough, the yellow circle will take care of itself. If Mars is affordable and safe and you know you&#8217;ll be able to come back, a lot of people will want to go.</p>
<p class="p1">The hard part is the blue circle. Here&#8217;s the issue:</p>
<p class="p1">Last time the US Congress checked with NASA, the cost to send a five-person crew to Mars was $50 billion. $10 billion a person. Elon thinks that to make the blue circle sufficiently large, it needs to cost $500,000 a person. 1/20,000 of the current cost.</p>
<p class="p1">1/20,000.</p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s like looking at the car industry and saying, &#8220;Right now a new Honda costs around $20,000. To make this a viable industry, we need to get the cost of a new car down to $1.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So what the heck?</p>
<p class="p1">Here&#8217;s the heck:</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine if the way planes worked was that they took off, flew to their destination, but then instead of landing, all the passengers parachuted down to the ground and then the plane landed by smashing into the ocean and blowing up. So every plane flew exactly once, and to have a new flight happen, you&#8217;d have to build another plane.</p>
<p class="p1">A plane ticket would cost $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="p1">Space travel is currently so expensive mostly because we land rockets by crashing them into the ocean (or incinerating them in the atmosphere).</p>
<p class="p1">When Elon started SpaceX, he was determined to fix this problem. It was a tall order, given that no one had ever done it before—including nations like the US and Russia who had spent billions trying. But SpaceX puzzled away at the problem year after year, and after trying and failing a bunch of times, in late 2015, they nailed it:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMFZN3FyNlk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Then they nailed it again. And again. And again. Now they nail it more often than not. Here&#8217;s a daytime view of a recent landing:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPGUQySBikQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Soon, for the first time, a previously used-and-landed, flight-tested Falcon 9 will carry out a new mission for SpaceX, officially making SpaceX rockets &#8220;reusable.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">To fly a mission on a used rocket, you only need to pay for propellant (fuel and liquid oxygen) and a bit of routine maintenance. This cuts the price of space travel down by 100 or even 1,000 times.</p>
<p class="p1">That leaves us with somewhere between 19/20 and 199/200 of the cost left to cut. Part of that will happen when SpaceX takes 100 or more people to Mars at a time, instead of five (the number Congress asked NASA about). The rest of it is taken care of by a few simple innovations, like refueling the spaceships in orbit (which lowers the cost by 5-10x) and manufacturing propellant on Mars so you don&#8217;t have to carry your return propellant with you (which lowers the cost by another 5-10x). More on those things later.</p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly, not only can the price get down to $500,000/ticket, it can probably go even lower (Elon thinks it could eventually cost under $100,000/person). You may not have noticed it yet, but SpaceX&#8217;s innovations are in the process of creating a total revolution in the cost of space travel—a change that will open doors we can&#8217;t imagine being open today. And when that revolution goes far enough, SpaceX&#8217;s vision of putting 1,000,000 people on Mars really—actually—seriously—may happen.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re going to Mars. And this week, SpaceX showed us the thing that&#8217;s gonna take us there.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 22pt;"><strong>The Rocket</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It’s so mind-blowing. It blows my mind, and I see it every week.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Elon&#8217;s pumped. And when you learn about the big freaking rocket he&#8217;s building, you&#8217;ll understand why.</p>
<p class="p1">First, let&#8217;s absorb the challenge at hand. It&#8217;s often said that space is hard. To this day, only a few hundred people have been in space, only a few countries have the ability to launch something into space, and the history of human space travel is littered with tragic launch failures. Firing something super heavy and delicate and full of explosive liquid up through the atmosphere without anything going wrong is incredibly hard.</p>
<p class="p1">But when we talk about humans going into space, we&#8217;re talking mostly about humans going into Low Earth Orbit, a layer of space between 100 and 1,200 miles above the ground—and normally, they&#8217;re headed only 250 miles up to the International Space Station. The only time humans have gone farther were the small handful of Americans who made it out to the moon in the 1960s, traveling about 250,000 miles away.</p>
<p class="p1">When Earth and Mars are at their closest, Mars is somewhere between 34 and 60 million miles away—about 200 times farther away than the moon and about 200,000 times farther away than the ISS.</p>
<p class="p1">The moon is just over one light second away.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5722" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second.png" alt="distance diagram of Earth and the moon with a bar representing 1 light second that nearly reaches the moon" width="829" height="160" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second.png 8499w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second-300x58.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second-768x149.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/light-second-600x116.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Mars is more than three light <em>minutes </em>away.</p>
<p class="p1">Mars is far.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon likes to compare the Earth-to-Mars trip to crossing the Atlantic Ocean, noting that using that scale, going to the moon would only be crossing the English Channel (and going to the ISS would be going to a dock 117 feet off the shore). Continuing with that comparison, he says, &#8220;A rocket made to go to Low Earth Orbit or even the moon is basically like a coastal fishing vessel, compared to a colonial transport system that is trying to go 1,000 times further.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">On top of that, it might be worth it to take only a few humans or a single satellite up into Low Earth Orbit—but if you&#8217;re going all the way to Mars, you want to take a <em>lot </em>more than that. So you have to take much more mass, much further. Multiplying the distance factor by the payload factor, Elon explains that a Mars transport system &#8220;is like literally a million times more capable than what the current world launch system can do. It has to be.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">It also has to be incredibly advanced. Elon says, &#8220;It’s not just bigger, it needs to be more efficient. There&#8217;s a false dichotomy when it comes to rockets of &#8216;small and complex&#8217; or &#8216;big and dumb.&#8217; People talk about the &#8216;big dumb booster&#8217;—that won&#8217;t work. You need a big smart booster. If you want to build a Mars colony, you have no choice— you have to make it big and efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So that&#8217;s all you have to do—build a rocket that&#8217;s a million times more capable than today&#8217;s best rockets but who&#8217;s also efficient and smart and a good listener.</p>
<p class="p1">SpaceX is building it. Meet the Big Freaking Rocket.<a href="#footnote2-1-5766" id="note2-1-5766" rel="footnote2">1</a>

<p class="p1">Hard to quite understand the bigness from that picture. So let&#8217;s add in some scale:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-house.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5748" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-house.jpg" alt="spacex mars rocket with house and person drawn to scale" width="500" height="1552" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-house.jpg 1875w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-house-97x300.jpg 97w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-house-768x2384.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-house-193x600.jpg 193w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Or how about this?</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-field-2-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5749" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-field-2-1.jpg" alt="spacex mars rocket shown over a football field for scale" width="850" height="500" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-field-2-1.jpg 5245w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-field-2-1-300x177.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-field-2-1-768x452.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BFR-field-2-1-600x353.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It would <em>barely </em>fit diagonally across a football field without going into the stands.</p>
<p class="p1">There&#8217;s also this:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bfr-boston.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5746" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bfr-boston.png" alt="spacex mars rocket in skyline for scale" width="850" height="285" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bfr-boston.png 1000w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bfr-boston-300x101.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bfr-boston-768x257.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bfr-boston-600x201.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a <em>skyscraper</em>. Or as Elon puts it, &#8220;by far the biggest flying object ever.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">In yesterday&#8217;s presentation, Elon explained that this isn&#8217;t a first crack at how it might look, or an artist&#8217;s impression of how it might look—it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to look. This is the thing they&#8217;re building.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, SpaceX seems to be going through an existential crisis when it comes to naming this thing—first it was the Mars Colonial Transporter, then (because it can go <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/776939304140414976" target="_blank">way past Mars</a>) it was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/777325549442232320" target="_blank">renamed</a> the Interplanetary Transport System, then yesterday in the presentation, Elon said they haven&#8217;t actually settled on a name yet but that the specific spaceship that makes the maiden voyage to Mars might be called Heart of Gold<a href="#footnote-1-5766" id="note-1-5766" rel="footnote">1</a>—so no one knows what to call it.</p>
<p class="p1">Which is why—until I hear otherwise—I&#8217;ll be calling it something Elon once referred to it as: the Big Freaking Rocket (BFR).</p>
<p class="p1">The Big Freaking Rocket is freaking big. At 400 feet tall, it&#8217;s the height of a 40-story skyscraper. At 40 feet in diameter, a school bus could fit entirely underneath its footprint. It&#8217;s more than three times the mass and generates over three times the thrust of the gargantuan <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/s/satvb.jpg" target="_blank">Saturn V</a>—the rocket used in the Apollo mission—which currently stands as by far the biggest rocket humanity has made.</p>
<p class="p1">Here&#8217;s how it stacks up next to a bunch of other rockets in size:</p>

<p class="p1">The difference is even more extreme when you compare the rockets by how many kilograms of payload (i.e. cargo and/or people) they can each take to orbit:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5761 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2.png" alt="rocket-lineup-2" width="1369" height="369" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2.png 1369w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2-300x81.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2-768x207.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-lineup-2-600x162.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1369px) 100vw, 1369px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">For comparison, SpaceX&#8217;s awesome <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9" target="_blank">Falcon 9</a> rocket will be able to take about 4 tons of payload to Mars, and the <a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy" target="_blank">Falcon Heavy</a>—which is about to be today&#8217;s most powerful rocket—will be able to take about 13 tons to Mars. Elon believes the BFR will be able to take a few <em>hundred </em>tons of payload to Mars at first and eventually be able to take <em>1,000 </em>tons. The absurdity of that statistic—that the behemoth Falcon Heavy can only manage a little over 1% of the BFR&#8217;s ultimate Mars payload—is pretty hard to absorb.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, to be clear—what I&#8217;ve been calling the Big Freaking Rocket this whole time is actually two things: a Big Freaking Spaceship sitting on top of a Big Freaking Booster.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5762" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2.png" alt="diagram of spacex mars rocket. spaceship: crew cabin, cargo cabin, liquid oxygen tank, methane fuel tank, 9 Raptor engines. booster: liquid oxygen tank, methane fuel tank, 42 Raptor engines" width="785" height="680" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2.png 1096w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2-300x260.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2-768x665.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Rocket-breakdown-2-600x520.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Big Freaking Booster</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s start by talking about the booster. The 25-story-high booster—AKA the actual rocket of the BFR—is what Elon calls &#8220;quite a beast.&#8221; It&#8217;s the biggest booster of all time—by <em>far</em>. By physical size, definitely, but even more so by thrust.</p>
<p class="p1">In the SpaceX post, I <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/4" target="_blank">talked about</a> the Falcon 9&#8217;s nine <a href="http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/03/26/merlin-engines" target="_blank">Merlin engines</a>, and how each one was powerful enough to lift a stack of 40 cars up into the sky—in total, that meant the Falcon 9 set of engines could lift 360 cars. The Falcon Heavy, with its 27 Merlin engines, could lift a stack of over 1,000 cars up past the clouds.<a href="#footnote-2-5766" id="note-2-5766" rel="footnote">2</a>
<p class="p1">The Big Freaking Booster sits atop a different kind of engine: the Raptor.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5726" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor.jpg" alt="spacex raptor engine" width="400" height="642" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor.jpg 2460w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor-187x300.jpg 187w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor-768x1233.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Raptor-374x600.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The Raptor engine looks a lot like a Merlin, with one key difference—by significantly increasing the pressure, SpaceX has made the Raptor over three times more powerful than a Merlin.</p>
<p class="p1">A single Raptor engine produces <em>310 tons</em> of thrust—enough to lift 310 tons, or a stack of 172 cars, or <em>an entire Boeing 747 airplane</em>, into the sky. That&#8217;s what <em>one </em>Raptor can do.<a href="#footnote-3-5766" id="note-3-5766" rel="footnote">3</a>
<p class="p1">And the BFB has <em>42 of them</em>.<a href="#footnote-4-5766" id="note-4-5766" rel="footnote">4</a>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5727" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors.jpg" alt="view of 42 Raptor engines" width="450" height="420" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors.jpg 3170w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors-300x280.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors-768x717.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/42-Raptors-600x560.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">All together, that&#8217;s an unheard of 13,033 tons of thrust, enough to push more than 7,000 cars—or <em>50 </em>large airplanes—up to space.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The Big Freaking Spaceship</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">So then there&#8217;s the spacecraft—which SpaceX calls the Interplanetary Spaceship, and which I&#8217;m going to keep calling the Big Freaking Spaceship because it&#8217;s more fun. The BFS is the big cool-looking thing on top of the BFB (in case you&#8217;re getting Big Freaking Confused—the Big Freaking Spaceship (BFS) on top of the Big Freaking Booster (BFB) together make what I&#8217;ve been calling the Big Freaking Rocket (BFR)). The BFS is what will take the people and cargo to Mars. It&#8217;s also what will launch, on its own, off Mars and return to Earth with people who want to come back.</p>
<p class="p1">The BFS is itself the size of a tall, 16-story building, and is 55 feet wide at its thickest point. In addition to hundreds, and eventually a thousand tons of cargo, the BFS will be able to carry as many as 100 people at the beginning, and Elon believes that number could grow to 200 and even above 300 people over time—like a cruise ship.</p>
<p class="p1">With nine Raptor engines, it&#8217;ll have more liftoff thrust on its own than any of today&#8217;s rockets—including next year&#8217;s Falcon Heavy. For a second-stage, cargo-carrying spacecraft to pack more thrust than even the most powerful first-stage rockets is outrageous.</p>
<p class="p1">Here&#8217;s a cross-section up close:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5751" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section.jpg" alt="cross section of spacex mars spacecraft" width="414" height="1060" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section.jpg 1653w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section-117x300.jpg 117w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section-768x1966.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rocket-cross-section-234x600.jpg 234w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I asked Elon what it&#8217;ll be like to ride in it. He said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;d be in a giant spaceship in microgravity.<a href="#footnote-5-5766" id="note-5-5766" rel="footnote">5</a> I mean, it would be pretty fun. You&#8217;d be floating around.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Good point.</p>
<p class="p1">In the presentation Q&amp;A, he added: &#8220;It has to be really fun and exciting, it can&#8217;t feel cramped or boring. The crew compartment is set up so that you can do zero-g games, you can float around, there will be movies, lecture halls, cabins, a restaurant—it&#8217;ll be really fun to go.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Um, yeah, get me on that thing now. <em>A zero gravity cruise ship</em>. With this view:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5765" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1.png" alt="observatory_f_hd_3-1" width="850" height="425" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1.png 1297w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1-300x150.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1-768x384.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Observatory_F_HD_3.1-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And if you were to go, here&#8217;s how the whole thing would work:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>1) Get on the ship. </strong>The BFR will be taking off from pad 39A at Cape Canaveral, Florida—the same pad that the Apollo astronauts left from. This is because that pad was built to be absurdly large since they didn&#8217;t know yet how big a rocket they&#8217;d be using. When you get there, you head up the tower and across the bridge into the Big Freaking Spaceship.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5729" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge.jpg" alt="air-bridge" width="900" height="448" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge.jpg 2183w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge-300x149.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge-768x382.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Air-bridge-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>2) Take off. </strong>You strap in, and the BFR lifts off. After a few minutes, the first-stage BFB separates and heads back down to Earth. The BFS that you&#8217;re in continues onward and settles into Earth&#8217;s orbit.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5731" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o.jpg" alt="29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o" width="852" height="363" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o.jpg 1920w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o-300x128.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o-768x327.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29937258946_8345b8ae6e_o-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>3) Refuel in orbit. </strong>After landing back on Earth, the BFB is capped with a new BFS—this one full of propellant (liquid oxygen and methane).<a href="#footnote-6-5766" id="note-6-5766" rel="footnote">6</a> It lifts off again and pings the propellant-filled spaceship into orbit, where it rendezvouses<a href="#footnote-7-5766" id="note-7-5766" rel="footnote">7</a> with your spaceship. The two connect like two orcas holding hands as the propellant is transferred.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5732" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h.jpg" alt="29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h" width="850" height="362" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h.jpg 1600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h-300x128.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h-768x327.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/29343821794_9e05bfd6d7_h-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This happens a few more times until your spaceship is entirely refueled.<a href="#footnote-8-5766" id="note-8-5766" rel="footnote">8</a> This process is critical A) for lowering the cost of the trip, and B) for making the trip much faster. People have always thought a journey to Mars would take six or nine months, but the BFS will get there in three.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>4) H</strong><strong>ead to Mars. </strong>Three months of fun times in microgravity and getting really sick of the other people on the ship.<a href="#footnote-9-5766" id="note-9-5766" rel="footnote">9</a> During the journey, the spaceship steers using cold gas thrusters, powered by huge solar arrays:</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>5) Enter the Mars atmosphere.</strong> Time for the heat shield to be miserable:</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>6) Land on Mars. </strong>Upright, the same way the first stage lands on Earth.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>7) Live on Mars for a while doing god knows what. </strong>If it&#8217;s early on in the colonization process, you&#8217;re probably there to work and help build up the initial industries. Later on, it could be anything—research, entrepreneurship, or just simply adventure.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>8) Make propellant on Mars. </strong>This will be one of the key early industries to set up on Mars. Propellant consists of liquid oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which are both conveniently easy to make from the massive quantities of H<sub>2</sub>O (ice) and CO<sub>2 </sub>(the main gas in the Martian atmosphere) already sitting on Mars. They&#8217;ll use this propellant to load up the spaceship you came there on in preparation for its voyage back to Earth. Doing this spares the massive expense of having to carry propellant all the way from Earth for the return trip.</p>

<p class="p1">So that&#8217;s the deal with the Big Freaking Rocket and how it&#8217;ll all work.<a href="#footnote-10-5766" id="note-10-5766" rel="footnote">10</a>
<p class="p1">Now let&#8217;s talk about how this all might play out.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 22pt;"><strong>The Plan</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Back to reality. So how do we get from, &#8220;there&#8217;s this rad potential rocket that might be ready to launch in five years&#8221; to &#8220;we&#8217;re a thriving multi-planetary civilization with a million people on Mars&#8221;?</p>
<p class="p1">10,000 flights. That&#8217;s how many BFS trips to Mars Elon thinks it&#8217;ll take to bring the Mars population to a million.</p>
<p class="p1">Why 10,000? Because there will be at least 100 people on most trips, and that number will go up over time—but there will also be some people coming back from Mars each time other people go. In the lower part of each BFS will be a huge cargo compartment. Elon thinks we&#8217;ll need to get at least 10 million tons of cargo to Mars for the million-person colony to become self-sustaining, which will happen in a little over 10,000 flights if SpaceX can get the cargo payload capacity up to 1,000 tons relatively quickly, as they hope to.</p>
<p class="p1">And when will these 10,000 trips start?</p>
<p class="p1">Well let&#8217;s take a look at the Mars-Earth Synodic calendar—which deals with the dates when Earth and Mars are closest to each other (called a &#8220;Mars opposition&#8221;). Earth&#8217;s orbit is smaller than Mars&#8217;s, so Earth goes around the sun quicker—so much so that every 26 months, Earth laps Mars and they&#8217;re briefly next to each other. That&#8217;s the one time when Earth-Mars transfers can happen.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re currently pretty close to Mars, since the last Mars opposition happened on May 22, 2016. That&#8217;s why, if you happen to be an &#8220;oh look there&#8217;s a way-too-bright star let me take out my Sky Guide app and figure out which planet that is and then tell everyone I&#8217;m with and find that, yet again, no one cares, because everyone is a horrible person&#8221; nerd like me, you know that all summer, Mars has been super prominent and bright in our night sky.<a href="#footnote-11-5766" id="note-11-5766" rel="footnote">11</a> A year from now, Mars will be on the other side of the sun from us, and we won&#8217;t see it in our night sky at all.</p>
<p class="p1">The 2016 Earth-Mars opposition is also a special one, because it&#8217;s the last time it&#8217;ll happen without anybody talking about it.</p>
<p class="p1">Why? Because starting with the next one in July of 2018, SpaceX will start sending stuff to Mars each time there&#8217;s an opposition, and this will become increasingly big news each time. Here&#8217;s the tentative schedule, if everything goes perfectly to plan:</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Upcoming Mars Oppositions</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">– and what SpaceX is planning for each</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>July, 2018: </strong>Send a <a href="http://www.spacex.com/dragon" target="_blank">Dragon</a> spacecraft (the Falcon 9&#8217;s SUV-size spacecraft) to Mars with cargo</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>October, 2020: </strong>Send multiple Dragons with more cargo</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>December, 2022: </strong>Maiden BFS voyage to Mars. Carrying only cargo. This is the spaceship Elon wants to call Heart of Gold.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>January, 2025: </strong>First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s all go back and read that last line again.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>January, 2025: </strong>First people-carrying BFS voyage to Mars.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Did you catch that?</p>
<p class="p1">If things go to plan,<em> the Neil Armstrong of Mars will touch down about eight years from now.</em></p>
<p class="p1">And zero people are talking about it.</p>
<p class="p1">But they will be. The hype will start a couple years from now when the Dragons make their Mars trips, and it&#8217;ll kick into high gear in 2022 when the Big Freaking Spaceship finally launches and heads to Mars and lands there. Everyone will be talking about this.</p>
<p class="p1">And the buzz will just accelerate from there as the first group of BFS astronauts are announced and become household names, admired for their bravery, because everyone will know there&#8217;s a reasonable chance something goes wrong and they don&#8217;t make it back alive. Then, in 2024 they&#8217;ll take off on a three-month trip that&#8217;ll be front-page news every day. When they land, everyone on Earth will be watching. It&#8217;ll be 1969 all over again.</p>
<p class="p1">This is a thing that&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p class="p1">Elon doesn&#8217;t like when people ask him about this first voyage and the Neil Armstrong of Mars. He says that it&#8217;s not about humanity putting a new multi-planetary feather in its cap, and he&#8217;s quick to point out, &#8220;putting people on the moon was super exciting—but where&#8217;s our moon base?&#8221; In other words, having humanity give Mars a high five for bragging rights is not what matters—what matters is carrying out the full vision of actually creating a full, self-sustaining civilization on Mars.</p>
<p class="p1">And yeah, sure, fine. But <em>I&#8217;m excited for 2025</em>. It&#8217;s gonna be so fun.</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, so then the next Mars opposition will roll around in 2027. This time, if everything stays on track, multiple BFS&#8217;s will make the trek to Mars, carrying more people than were in the original group in 2025. And the spaceship that went over in 2025—the space Mayflower<em>—</em>will make its return trip to Earth, carrying some of the first group of Mars pioneers back home. They&#8217;ll return to massive celebration as international heroes, and the legendary spaceship will head off to enjoy its life in the Air and Space Museum.</p>
<p class="p1">Meanwhile, we&#8217;ll all be glued to the TV<a href="#footnote-12-5766" id="note-12-5766" rel="footnote">12</a> as the group of BFS&#8217;s arrive on Mars, where the people in them will continue the grueling work started by the 2025 group. The early colonists will have a hard job like early colonists always do—and this will be extra hard. Not only will they have to truly start from scratch—digging mines and quarries and refineries, constructing the first underground village habitat with the first Martian hospitals and schools and greenhouse farms, laying down a giant plumbing system to pump water into the village, building that first rocket propellant plant—but they&#8217;ll have to do all of this in a place where they can&#8217;t go outside without a spacesuit on, and where everyone and everything they&#8217;ve ever known is on a pale blue dot in the sky.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;ll be hard, but for the explorers of our world the payoff may be worth it. Elon says: &#8220;You can go anywhere on Earth in 24 hours. There&#8217;s no physical frontier on Earth anymore. Now, space is that frontier, so it’ll appeal to anyone with that exploratory spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">In April of 2029, SpaceX will send an even larger group of spacecraft, people, and cargo to Mars. This time, it&#8217;ll probably get less attention. By 2029, we&#8217;ll probably be getting used to the idea that there are people on Mars and that every 26 months, a great two-way migration occurs.</p>
<p class="p1">The growing Mars colony will continue to entice the adventurers—those who read about the great sailing exhibitions of the 15th and 16th centuries and yearn to be there. When I asked Elon about how the small colony will grow and evolve, he said: &#8220;Think of the Mars colony as an organism that starts off as a zygote, and then becomes multi-cellular, and then gets organ differentiation—so it doesn’t look exactly the same all the way along, any more than the first settlement in Jamestown wasn’t representative of the United States today. It’ll be the same with Mars—Mars will be the new New World.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The 2031 and 2033 and 2035 oppositions will bring substantially more people to the new New World. By this point, the budding Martian city will be a part of our lives. We&#8217;ll follow the Twitter feeds of some of our favorite journalists on Mars to keep up with what&#8217;s happening there. We&#8217;ll all get hooked on Mars&#8217;s first hit reality shows. And some of us will start thinking, &#8220;Should I sign up to go to Mars one of these years before I get too old?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">By 2050, there will be over a hundred thousand people on Mars. The company your son works for might have a branch there, and he&#8217;ll be saying goodbye to a couple co-workers who are about to head to the planet for a 52-month stint. He tells you that he doesn&#8217;t want to go because he doesn&#8217;t want to take his ninth-grade daughter away from her life and her friends. But he says she&#8217;s applying to a program that would bring her to Mars from the ages of 17 to 23 for an urban planning degree. You worry, even though you know it&#8217;s irrational. It&#8217;s just that you remember the days when going to Mars was risky and dangerous, and some part of you is still uncomfortable with it. And what if she decides not to come back?</p>
<p class="p1">By 2065, the early days of Mars seem primitive. During the first few Mars migrations, only a few spaceships made the trip with only 100 people in each, it was prohibitively expensive to go, it took three months to get there, and there were only a few very grueling industries on Mars to work in.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2065, every Mars opposition sees over 1,000 ships make the trip, each carrying over 500 people and a couple thousand tons of cargo. Half a million people make the journey every two years, and about 50,000 less than that come back, because Earth-to-Mars migration capacity grows a little bit each time as more ships are built. The trip, which now takes only 30 days, costs only $60,000 (in 2016 dollars)—and most people just pay off the ticket price with their well-paying job on Mars (labor is in high demand as the early Mars cities continue to expand and new cities are built).</p>
<p class="p1">Many people remember those early days of the Mars colony when it was all about SpaceX—funded by SpaceX or their cargo clients and driven by their ambition and their ingenuity and their guts. But now, dozens of companies specialize in Earth-Mars transit and hundreds of companies focus on development and entrepreneurship on Mars. And transit is paid for like planes and trains and buses are paid for today—by passengers buying tickets.</p>
<p class="p1">A decade later, the 2074 migration brings the Mars population above a million people. Small celebrations break out around both worlds, as a long-awaited landmark is achieved. Most people though, don&#8217;t even notice.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p class="p1">Everything I just said was based on things Elon said on my phone call with him. Some of it was numbers he said directly—like the last paragraph, which came from him saying, “I’m hopeful that we can get to a million roughly 50 years after the start.” Other times it was me extrapolating a possible future, given the predictions I heard from him. It&#8217;s all based in reality. At least, it&#8217;s based in Elon Musk&#8217;s best crack at reality. He was very careful to qualify everything that sounded like a prediction or a projection with, &#8220;This is what <em>might </em>happen <em>if</em> things go well—but there&#8217;s no way to know, and many things could go wrong along the way.&#8221; He emphasized that &#8220;it&#8217;s not that SpaceX has all the answers and we&#8217;ve got it covered or anything like that—it&#8217;s that we want to show that it&#8217;s possible. But it&#8217;s far from a given.&#8221; As for things that could go wrong, he listed off a few (like World War III), and one of his biggest concerns is that if he somehow dies young, SpaceX could be taken over by someone who wants to milk the company for profit instead of staying single-mindedly focused on the Mars civilization mission.</p>
<p class="p1">But if SpaceX can manage to get this thing started, Elon thinks it could be not just a big deal in itself, it could jumpstart a slew of new possibilities for humanity. He explains:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The big picture isn&#8217;t just to back up the hard drive but to really change humanity into a multi-planetary species. Essentially what we’re saying is we’re establishing a regular cargo route to Mars. With the economic forcing function of interplanetary commerce, there will be the resources and the incentive to massively improve space transport technology, and I think then things really go to a whole new level. </em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>What I’m describing may sound really crazy, but it actually will be a small fraction of what is ultimately done, as long as we become a two-planet civilization. Look at shipping technology in Europe. When all you had to do was cross the Mediterranean, the ships were pretty lame—they couldn’t cross the Atlantic. So commerce basically had short-range vessels. Without the forcing function, shipping technology didn’t improve that much—you could do the same things with ships, pretty much, around the time of Julius Caesar as you could around the time of Columbus. 1,500 years later, you could still just cross the Mediterranean. But as soon as there was a reason to cross the Atlantic, shipping technology improved dramatically. There needed to be the American colonies in order for that to happen.</em></p>
<p class="p1">The people at SpaceX believe that once we&#8217;re on Mars, the rest of the Solar System becomes accessible as well. That&#8217;s why they didn&#8217;t just create images of their Big Freaking Rocket standing proudly on Mars. They showed it flying by Jupiter.</p>

Elon thinks the dangers are overstated, and that with proper precautions (like a protective layer of water around the crew cabin), the radiation harm to a crew member would be similar to the damage to your body if you were to become a smoker during those three months and then stop.

He talked about the possibility of the BFR&#8217;s spaceship doubling as a super-fast way to transport stuff or people around the Earth: &#8220;It actually has enough capability that you could maybe even go to orbit with the spaceship&#8230;and maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world&#8230;We could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45 minutes at the longest—most would be maybe 20, 25 minutes. So maybe if we had a floating platform off the coast of New York, you could go from New York to Tokyo in 25 minutes. You could cross the Atlantic in 10 minutes. Most of your time would be getting to the ship, and then it would be real quick after that. There are some intriguing possibilities there, but we’re not counting on that.&#8221; YES. Amazing glimpse of the world of the future, when someone will text you from Delhi and ask if you want to zip over from San Francisco to grab lunch, and you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Sure, but I have a meeting in two hours, so I can&#8217;t stay long.&#8221; Except you won&#8217;t, because you&#8217;ll just meet your friend virtually and it&#8217;ll feel exactly how it would to be there in person.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s not really any normal way to start a relationship. Some people go on a date, and then another date, and then another, and one day it&#8217;s just clear to both of them that they&#8217;re in a relationship. Some people start seeing each other, but they keep things black and white until a &#8220;So are we doing this?&#8221; conversation makes it official. Sometimes a platonic friendship forms first and tension builds under the surface until an unexpected kiss lights the friendship on fire.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s usually some first time that this happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R1-girlfriend.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5624" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R1-girlfriend.png" alt="(holding hands) stick 1: so does this mean... that you're my girlfriend? / stick 2: yeah...

<p>And suddenly, you&#8217;re here:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R2-on-a-cloud.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5633" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R2-on-a-cloud.jpg" alt="couple floating on a cloud" width="600" height="460" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R2-on-a-cloud.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R2-on-a-cloud-300x230.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R2-on-a-cloud-768x589.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R2-on-a-cloud-600x460.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Your new relationship is with you all the time, even when you&#8217;re not together.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R3-smiling-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5650" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R3-smiling-1.png" alt="smiling on a subway car" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R3-smiling-1.png 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R3-smiling-1-300x200.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R3-smiling-1-768x511.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R3-smiling-1-600x400.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R3-smiling-1-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve left the rest of shitty humanity behind, and it feels great. Then this happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R4-love-you.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5649" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R4-love-you.png" alt="stick figure couple on park bench. &quot;I love you&quot;" width="500" height="383" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R4-love-you.png 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R4-love-you-300x230.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R4-love-you-768x589.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/R4-love-you-600x460.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>

<p>And all the song lyrics make sense.</p>
<p>It goes on like this for a while, but as the months pass, you notice things changing. The unicorns turn into horses and then bikes and then one day, you&#8217;re not riding anything at all. The perfect person you found starts to say and do imperfect things. Some of those funny quirks you adored early on seem to be striking you as more annoying than funny. And it starts to dawn on you that you might be dating a fucking dick.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R6-angry.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5626" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R6-angry.png" alt="stick figure couple sitting on opposite ends of a couch, angry" width="500" height="351" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R6-angry.png 1112w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R6-angry-300x211.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R6-angry-768x539.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R6-angry-600x421.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Sometimes things go further south, as butterflies and rainbows turn into frustration and disillusionment, and the relationship that used to lift you up seems to now be boxing you in.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R7-Cage.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5627" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R7-Cage.png" alt="stick figure in a cage" width="418" height="320" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R7-Cage.png 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R7-Cage-300x230.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R7-Cage-768x589.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R7-Cage-600x460.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /></a></p>
<p>All of the negative qualities you couldn&#8217;t see in the fog of love are suddenly right in your face, like a weight that&#8217;s dragging you down.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R8-ball-and-chain.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5628" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R8-ball-and-chain.png" alt="stick figure ball and chain" width="500" height="383" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R8-ball-and-chain.png 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R8-ball-and-chain-300x230.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R8-ball-and-chain-768x589.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/R8-ball-and-chain-600x460.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>A lot of relationships end right about here.</p>
<p>But maybe, having seen the dark side of your partner, you step back and take a long look at both the good and bad together. You put away both the rose-colored glasses and the shit-colored glasses and see who you&#8217;re really dating: a three-dimensional, one-of-a-kind, beautiful, piece-of-shit human being.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s the best.</p>

<p>Society, in most parts of the world, doesn&#8217;t like when a relationship lasts too long. To society, a relationship is simply a testing ground—an incubator that prepares you for The Decision. And if too many years go by in a relationship without The Decision being made, society decides that something must be wrong. To help right the wrong, society will begin to apply pressure on the couple, from all angles.</p>
<p>Some people are bigger than society. Most of us are not. For most of us, society&#8217;s rules are our rules, and as you and your person walk down your blue balance beam, you can feel the walking space melt away around you. It&#8217;s time to make The Decision.</p>
<p>Your relationship needs to be converted into Everything Forever or Nothing Ever Again. Soon.</p>
<p>The typical human isn&#8217;t really equipped to make The Decision. We evolved to live short lives, during which life-altering 60-year commitments weren&#8217;t a thing. We evolved in small communities without nearly as many available options. And most of us, when presented with The Decision, have relatively little relationship experience and an incomplete understanding of our own adult selves—selves that in many cases only recently started existing.</p>
<p>But society doesn&#8217;t care. So you decide.</p>
<p>Humans have come up with four main methods to make The Decision:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Method 1) Let the other person decide</strong></span></p>
<p>The easiest way to handle The Decision is to just not really handle it. You<span class="s1"> take a passive approach, as if you&#8217;re on a raft, going down a river, and you have no control over where the current leads you—you&#8217;re in the hands of momentum and inertia. Once you hit your mid-20s, you just wait until you get into your next relationship and then marry whoever that person happens to be, whenever/if-ever that person decides it&#8217;s time, regardless of how right or wrong the relationship is for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Method 2) Let your primal forces battle it out</strong></span></p>
<p>For people determined to more actively make The Decision, the next easiest way to go is to let your emotions and primal forces figure it out. Making The Decision provides a reminder that &#8220;you&#8221; is actually a collection of voices, each weighing in from different parts of evolutionary history. Each voice has its role in the homeostasis of our normal lives, but when it&#8217;s time for something as rare and important as The Decision, there&#8217;s suddenly a brawl in your head for influence—and no one brawls harder than your primal forces. Some of the major players:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Love</strong></span></p>
<p>Deep down, most people are sympathetic characters. And when you&#8217;re in a relationship for enough time, you&#8217;ll usually end up loving the person—even if you don&#8217;t like them. You know their whole story, which makes you care about them and the fact that they rely on you makes you feel a tremendous loyalty to them. This is the kind of love you feel for your family and closest friends, and it can exist in full force even after the feeling of being &#8220;in love&#8221; has faded. And for many people, this deep emotional connection makes it basically inconceivable to ever break up with their partner. This is a beautiful way to make The Decision when you&#8217;re in a strong, healthy relationship, and a tragedy when you&#8217;re not.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Fear</strong></span></p>
<p>Humans specialize in making critical life decisions based on fear, and when it comes to The Decision, there&#8217;s a lot to be afraid of.</p>
<p>When a fearful person takes a look to the left side of the balance beam, they might see all kinds of things:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-breakup-2.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5653" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-breakup-2.png" alt="fear monsters on the &quot;soul-crushing breakup&quot; side" width="600" height="422" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-breakup-2.png 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-breakup-2-300x211.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-breakup-2-768x540.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-breakup-2-600x422.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>The right side of the beam isn&#8217;t much better.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-marriage-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5654" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-marriage-2.png" alt="fear monsters on the &quot;permanent marriage till you die&quot; side" width="600" height="460" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-marriage-2.png 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-marriage-2-300x230.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-marriage-2-768x589.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fear-marriage-2-600x460.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Different people feel these fears at different levels of intensity, and for someone whose fear tends to run their life, it&#8217;s usually pretty simple: the particular fear that grabs them hardest by the collar ends up making The Decision.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Ego</strong></span></p>
<p>Your ego, meanwhile, is busy staring down at a clipboard. Depending on what your ego values, that clipboard might display a checklist describing your ideal partner—their appearance, age, family background, intelligence, job, wealth, general personality type, etc. Or maybe the clipboard has a story written on it, one that was written long ago about how your life should go. Your ego will examine your current situation and see how it measures up to what&#8217;s written on the clipboard, and it&#8217;ll base The Decision on its findings.</p>
<p>While all of this analysis is going on, your ego sometimes also finds itself getting very hungry—for admiration, attention, and conquest. If this hunger gets too intense, it can overwhelm an ego to the point where it may sway its vote, no matter what the clipboard says.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Sex Drive</strong></span></p>
<p>Your sex drive is not a complicated character. If it has a grilled cheese sandwich every day for lunch and then one day, you ask it if it would like to try the buffet, it&#8217;s going to say yes. Unless, of course, the grilled cheese is super fucking incredible.</p>
<p>So these four primal forces, along with a few others, all voice their opinion at the same time. In some people, all of the voices are in agreement about the verdict. In others, the voices disagree, but one of the voices is so loud that it drowns out the others. In both of those cases, The Decision is pretty easy.</p>
<p>But what happens when your primal forces provide no clear answer?</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Method 3) Turn to your gut</span></strong></p>
<p>For some reason, we have wise stomachs, and when The Decision isn&#8217;t obvious, sometimes asking your gut can do the trick.</p>
<p>Your gut relies on your intuition and asks one simple question:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gut.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5640" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gut.png" alt="gut - &quot;does this feel right?&quot;" width="400" height="383" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gut.png 790w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gut-300x287.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gut-768x736.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gut-600x575.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>And what makes your gut your gut is that when it answers that question, it doesn&#8217;t deliberate—it just knows the answer: a simple yes or a simple no. The gut doesn&#8217;t deal with nuance, which makes it a good match for something big and binary, like The Decision.</p>
<p>And for a lot of people, this works.</p>
<p>But there are some people who won&#8217;t end up being passive Deciders, or emotional Deciders, or gut Deciders—who won&#8217;t turn to any primal or instinctual voice when it comes to this particular decision. They&#8217;ll get to the bottom of this in <em>spite </em>of those voices—based on experience and evidence and data and facts. They won&#8217;t be instinct-driven or fear-driven or ego-driven or sex-driven—they&#8217;ll be guided by <em>rationality</em>.</p>
<p>The brain Deciders.</p>
<p>And when it comes time for them to make The Decision, they&#8217;re in big trouble.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Method 4) Figure it out in your brain</strong></span></p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is kind of like the brain&#8217;s brain. It&#8217;s the part of you that sorts through information and makes plans and predictions and weighs evidence. It&#8217;s great at using what it learns to draw conclusions about how to act or what to do—as long as it knows the rules of the game and has access to the right information. And when it&#8217;s time for The Decision, your brain will do what it always does when confronted by a fork in the road—it&#8217;ll attempt to think and assess and analyze its way to the optimal rational answer.</p>
<p>Something as important and permanent as The Decision requires conviction, and conviction requires a source. No source of conviction, no Decision.</p>
<p>The source of the heart&#8217;s conviction is its love and care for the other person. The source of the ego&#8217;s conviction is its belief in its clipboard. Fear and sex drive derive their conviction from the obvious—fear and sex. The source of the gut&#8217;s conviction is an instinctive feeling that emerges from experience. And an inertia-y person gets their conviction from the conviction of someone else. Those sources are what allow people to make The Decision with relative ease.</p>
<p>The brain hears these voices, but it discredits their conviction in each case because the certainty emerges from what the brain sees as an irrational place. For the brain, the only respectable source of conviction is sound evidence.</p>
<p>And good luck with that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re typically a brain person, when it comes to The Decision, you want to try to not be you. Because the brain, for all its merits, does not do well in this situation, where the outcome is critical and evidence is hard to come by. Let&#8217;s look at how it might go:</p>
<p>Maybe you start by looking over to the marriage side of the balance beam—where you see a house.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/house.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5643" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/house.jpg" alt="house" width="500" height="383" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/house.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/house-300x230.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/house-768x589.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/house-600x460.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the house of the life you&#8217;re about to sign up for. You really enjoy your relationship, so you&#8217;re excited about what might be inside that house. But the house is also mysterious, because you don&#8217;t really know what either you or your partner will be like as a spouse or how either of you will grow or change in the future. Not much concrete evidence there.</p>
<p>So you turn and look over at the breakup side of the beam. You see a path, and a couple walking down it.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/road.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5642" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/road.jpg" alt="stick figure couple walking down a road" width="500" height="383" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/road.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/road-300x230.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/road-768x589.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/road-600x460.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>That road is whatever life you&#8217;d end up living if you were to move on from your relationship, and that&#8217;s the marriage you&#8217;d end up in. The marriage that might have been.</p>
<p>What kind of marriage would that be, and what adventures lie down that road? Maybe your life on that road would be much happier than whatever&#8217;s in that house on the other side, and maybe your current partner would end up happier somewhere else too. Or maybe you&#8217;d look back and realize that you made the biggest mistake of your life. Without knowing anything about that other path, there&#8217;s no way to compare it to the house on the other side. Again, no real evidence.</p>
<p>So you take a closer look at the one thing you have actual information about: your current relationship.</p>
<p>You decide to make a big chart where you list all the things you like and don&#8217;t like about your relationship—a relationship-assessment chart. You end up here:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5645" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn.png" alt="Venn: Things I Want to Have in a Relationship and Things I Don't Want to Deal With in a Relationship. (from left to right) blue: Things I Wish I Had, green: Things I'm Happy I Have, yellow: Things I Wish I Didn't Have to Deal With, red: Things I'm Happy I Don't Have to Deal With" width="600" height="416" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn.png 1314w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-300x208.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-768x532.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-600x416.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Fucking great—now what? All relationships—the good ones and the bad ones—have a chart that looks like that, with things in all four of those zones: blue, green, yellow, and red. And without much relationship experience or marriage expertise, you have no good way to evaluate whether your particular diagram looks as promising as you hope it does or whether there are red flags in it that you&#8217;re not seeing that will lead to major issues later. You try comparing your relationship to those that your friends are in—but it&#8217;s hard to know what really goes on in other relationships, and each one is so complicated and unique anyway that it&#8217;s mostly apples and oranges.</p>
<p>Without any way to construct an airtight argument in either direction, you&#8217;re left feeling very little conviction about the situation. Because the stakes are so high, you become paranoid about making the wrong choice, and every time you think you might have an answer, you second-guess yourself.</p>
<p>The whole thing quickly becomes a mindfuck. You try talking yourself into feeling good about marriage by reminding yourself that every relationship has flaws and that marriage is all about acceptance—but then you realize that that&#8217;s also exactly how someone sounds when they&#8217;re talking themselves into settling for the wrong person. In both of those cases, the green and red zones of the diagram provide more than enough material to construct a full &#8220;why this is a great decision&#8221; argument. Likewise, if you wanted to play devil&#8217;s advocate and look at the reasons this might <em>not</em> be the right marriage for you, the blue and yellow sections of the diagram would make it easy—whether breaking up is a wise move or a foolish one.</p>
<p>And because the diagram and its four zones allow you to so effortlessly construct whatever convincing narrative you want to about your relationship and The Decision, you worry that anything that feels like conviction is just you falling for a narrative created by fear or ego or some other deep-down motivation.</p>
<p>Unable to come to a trustworthy conclusion, the brain person becomes a Paralyzed Pre-Marriage Relationship Person. A PPMRP has three options:</p>
<p><strong>1) Procrastinate. </strong>Until you die, until your partner dies, or until your partner breaks up with you.</p>
<p><strong>2) Turn back around and succumb to one of the primal forces. </strong>Maybe if you wait for a while, your fear of being single at 36 will overpower your dedication to rationality?</p>
<p><strong>3) Come up with a decision-making litmus test that actually works.</strong></p>
<p>Assuming you don&#8217;t find the first two options ideal, let&#8217;s talk about litmus tests.</p>
<p>The &#8220;actually works&#8221; part of option 3 is important, because people often come up with decision-making litmus tests that don&#8217;t actually tell you anything. For example:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>An overly-broad, one-size-fits-all litmus test is a bad litmus test. </strong></span></p>
<p>Like, &#8220;If I&#8217;m still toiling over this three years in, that&#8217;s probably a sign this isn&#8217;t the right thing for me.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure if we&#8217;ve been together this long, there&#8217;s a good reason for that.&#8221; Or, &#8220;If I still have the desire to sleep with other people, it must mean my heart&#8217;s not in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Litmus tests like those suggest that <em>everyone </em>who toils over the marriage decision should break up or that <em>every </em>couple who&#8217;s together for a long time should get married or that <em>no </em>one in a great relationship still wants to sleep with other people. Different people do things like toil or stay together or feel promiscuous—or 100 other things—for totally different reasons, so broad statements like those don&#8217;t help with anything.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>A litmus test that always yields the answer &#8220;We should get married&#8221; is a bad litmus test. </strong></span></p>
<p>Like, &#8220;When I picture them standing on the altar with someone else, it&#8217;s a horrible thought—that must mean it&#8217;s the right move to marry them.&#8221; Or, &#8220;When we broke up for three days last month, I missed them unbearably—and it told me all I need to know.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I care about them more than anything and really want the best for them—that&#8217;s how I know I want to be with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>All these litmus tests tell you is that you A) feel possessive, B) feel attached, and C) love the person. In <em>most</em> long<em> </em>relationships—good and bad—the people in them feel all three of these things. The only real information you learn with tests like these is that you are, in fact, in a relationship.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>A litmus test that always yields the answer &#8220;We should break up&#8221; is a bad litmus test.</strong></span></p>
<p>Any version of the question, &#8220;Is this person a great match for me in every important way?&#8221; or &#8220;Is this person the best person for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, the person isn&#8217;t a great match for you in every important way. That has never happened before in our species. Likewise, there are at least a few hundred million people in the world that match your sexual preference. Only one of them is the best possible person for you. The chances that you were ever in the same square mile as that person are tiny, and the chances that you&#8217;re currently dating them are you&#8217;re not currently dating them. Litmus tests like these either require you to have a delusional view of your partner or the world, or they&#8217;re pretty much guaranteed to yield the conclusion that you need to break up and continue your quest for The One.</p>
<p>People struggling with The Decision crave guidance, and while statements like all of these can feel like a rescue line out of the PPMRP quagmire in the form of some larger wisdom, they don&#8217;t actually tell you anything about what you should do.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>A good system for tortured brain people</strong></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an expert on this, nor am I married—but I&#8217;ve read a lot about it, and I&#8217;ve had a front row seat for a large handful of case studies, watching friends go through The Decision and talking to them about it while it was happening. And I think if we just use common sense, we can probably figure out what a hopeless brain person can do in this situation—so let&#8217;s give it a try.</p>
<p>To me, a good system might be as simple as these two steps:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Step 1) Find out where your gut is leaning, using thought experiments.</strong></span></p>
<p>The gut is a real thing. And for our purposes here, your gut is the little kid in you who just <em>wants</em> one outcome more than the other.</p>
<p>The problem for brain people is that they&#8217;re by definition <em>not </em>gut people. The gut draws its wisdom from a mysterious place the prefrontal cortex does not understand, which makes brain people suspicious of the gut&#8217;s conclusions.</p>
<p>And suspicion is fine here, since your gut&#8217;s wisdom is limited by your experience and guts are often proven wrong with time—but the gut&#8217;s opinion is still important information.</p>
<p>Gut people have good practice at communicating with their gut about important decisions. Brain people do not—and the usual gut question—&#8221;does this feel right?&#8221;—won&#8217;t work. So we need to use thought experiments to isolate the gut&#8217;s voice amongst the cacophony in your head. Exercises like these are best designed by you, for you, since only you know you. But here are some ideas:</p>
<p>One kind of thought experiment creates a simulation in your head, which acts like a fishing fly, and our goal is to try to get the gut to be fooled by the simulation for a moment and jump at the bait, revealing what it really wants.</p>
<p>Something like: &#8220;Imagine you were being arranged married by the town matchmaker and she handed you an envelope with your to-be spouse&#8217;s name written inside. You open the envelope and it&#8217;s the name of your current partner.&#8221; This image might just make your gut jump up for a second and say, &#8220;Phew!&#8221; Or maybe instead, it would deflate just a little, just for a moment. If either happens, that&#8217;s good information.</p>
<p>Another type of thought experiment tries to get at the general yes or no feeling the question &#8220;does this feel right?&#8221; is supposed to reveal, but with some real on-the-nose imagery.</p>
<p>Like: &#8220;Picture two gravestones next to each other—yours and your partners. Does that feel right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the most telling thought experiments help hear what the gut&#8217;s saying by trying to remove the often deafening voice of fear from the question and seeing if that changes anything.</p>
<p>For example, to test whether a resistance to breaking up is just a dread of the actual breakup itself, you could ask: &#8220;If there were a big green button in front of me that, if pressed, would make me fully single, where everything has been worked out with getting our things from each other&#8217;s apartments, where everyone in my life already knows, and where I&#8217;m totally emotionally recovered and moving on—in fact, I have a date tonight—would I press the button?&#8221;</p>
<p>Or if the real fear is of being single for years and years and never finding a new relationship, the button could do all of those things but also include &#8220;and I&#8217;m immersed in a new relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fear of eternal commitment could be sussed out with a question like, &#8220;What if The Decision weren&#8217;t between breaking up and marriage, but only between breaking up and committing to the relationship for the next five years?&#8221;</p>
<p>If thought exercises like these leave you with the feeling that your inner inner self is &#8220;pulling&#8221; for the relationship, that&#8217;s promising.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Step 2) Figure out what your deal-breakers are.</strong></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s bring back our relationship assessment chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5645" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn.png" alt="relationship Venn diagram between &quot;things I want to have in a relationship&quot; and &quot;things I don't want to deal with in a relationship&quot;" width="600" height="416" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn.png 1314w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-300x208.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-768x532.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-600x416.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Venn-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>As we established earlier, this chart doesn&#8217;t provide much insight into how The Decision should go, because almost every relationship—the good and the bad, the healthy and the harmful, those built to last and those doomed to fail—has a chart like this, where it checks some of the right boxes and some of the wrong boxes, and also misses some of each. And yet, certain charts map out happy couples and others do not. So what&#8217;s the difference?</p>
<p>Deal-breakers.</p>
<p>Even though these charts show that there are many, many things we want from a relationship, our ability to be happy only <em>depends </em>on a small percentage of them.</p>
<p>Our relationship chart is like a happiness puzzle, and the items in the green and yellow zones are the pieces. The right question to ask about the chart isn&#8217;t, &#8220;Is this perfect for me?&#8221; or, &#8220;Will I automatically be happy if this is my chart?&#8221; The right question is, &#8220;How can I work with these pieces to figure out how to make myself and my partner happy?&#8221; If you&#8217;re a good puzzler, with some work and compromise—i.e. some adultness—you&#8217;ll probably be able to figure it out.</p>
<p><em>Unless </em>the chart is missing one of your deal-breakers.</p>
<p>Your deal-breakers are the things that, if not part of your relationship, will <em>guarantee </em>your unhappiness. They&#8217;re things that no amount of hard work or compromise or maturity can fix. Your must-haves—and your must-not-haves.</p>
<p>A deal-breaker usually comes in the format:</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who is / isn&#8217;t  ____.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who does / doesn&#8217;t ____.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who values / doesn&#8217;t value  ____.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who treats me / doesn&#8217;t treat me ____.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I can figure out how to be happy with someone who believes / doesn&#8217;t believe  ____.</p>
<p>Or maybe:</p>
<p>Out of principle, I will only be with / will not be with someone who ____.</p>
<p>Most real deal-breakers will be broad—e.g. &#8220;I may be able to fall in love with a negative person, but I could never be happy with that person.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I will never be with someone who makes my self-esteem lower.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I could never be happy with someone who isn&#8217;t intellectually curious.&#8221; Or something clean-cut like, &#8220;I could never be happy with someone who refused to have children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deal-breakers that are more specific in nature can in some cases make sense—maybe you love dogs so much that it would truly impede you from being a happy person if you ended up with someone who didn&#8217;t want to own a dog—but they should be rare.</p>
<p>The key with all of these is that there are very few. These aren&#8217;t wants—these are <em>needs</em>. Your wants are important, but remember, the only people even eligible for the deal-breaker test are those who have already passed the gut test—plenty of your wants have already been taken care of in step 1 of our system.</p>
<p>Knowing your deal-breakers can help you know the right relationship when you see it, but it can also go a long way for anyone already in a relationship, because it lends insight into one of the trickiest aspects of a relationship: compromise. A great way to be unhappy is to refuse to compromise on things you wish were true about your relationship that aren&#8217;t. But another great way to be unhappy is to be <em>too</em> willing to compromise on your deal-breakers. That&#8217;s why this is so important—deal-breakers not only help Deciders and single people figure out what should be unacceptable in a relationship, they also remind already-Decided people that most of the problems in their relationship are probably <em>non</em>-deal-breakers that it&#8217;s okay<em> </em>to chill out about. Because so many relationship problems boil down to one or both members treating non-deal-breakers like deal-breakers—or vice versa.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s really it. This gut check / deal-breakers system suggests that the mindfuck of The Decision is actually pretty simple—if a relationship successfully makes it through both steps 1 and 2, get married. If it doesn&#8217;t, don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>At least that&#8217;s what the system says.</p>
<p>But who knows. Relationships are impossibly complicated. And making a black-and-white binary decision about something that&#8217;s anything but black-and-white is kind of an insane thing to do.</p>
<p>And of course, even if it&#8217;s the right system, it&#8217;s not actually easy because assessing step 1 and step 2 isn&#8217;t easy. Getting a reading from your gut that you can trust is no small task for someone who typically lives in their brain—and figuring out what your deal-breakers are requires a serious deep-dive into your soul.</p>
<p>But for now, at least it&#8217;s a system—and a system you can hang on to. Which is just what some of us need.</p>

]]></description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Last weekend (August 13th and 14th) was Wait But Hi—a global hangout weekend for Wait But Why readers.</p>
<p>It started with a survey we sent out to the WBW <a data-sumome-listbuilder-id="4171d68e-76b7-4053-afde-d702db0d891c">email list</a> in early July. Using what we learned from the surveys, our team spent a large part of the summer strategically matchmaking groups of people together and creating customized activities to fit each group.</p>
<p>Then, on Saturday, it all happened at once—over 3,500 people participated in over 400 events that took place in 168 cities, in these 48 countries:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5414" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_WorldMap_NoKey.png" alt="WBH16_WorldMap_NoKey" width="870" height="435" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_WorldMap_NoKey.png 6460w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_WorldMap_NoKey-300x150.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_WorldMap_NoKey-768x384.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_WorldMap_NoKey-600x300.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" /></p>
<p>And Sunday was big group day, with large picnic gatherings in cities all over the world.</p>
<p>It was exciting:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TomSchepers08/status/764577217108074496" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5428 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_Social001.png" alt="WBH16_Social001" width="476" height="212" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_Social001.png 476w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WBH16_Social001-300x134.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></a></p>
<p>And a lot happened.</p>
<p>Like this dinner in Germany:</p>

<p>Or this one in Singapore:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJDdiQcAnrP/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5431 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WBH16_Social004.png" alt="WBH16_Social004" width="508" height="630" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WBH16_Social004.png 508w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WBH16_Social004-242x300.png 242w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WBH16_Social004-484x600.png 484w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></a></p>

<p>There were thought-provoking questions:</p>

<p>Controversial opinions:</p>

<p>And pressing debates:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/samsambamalam/status/764412476951703552/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5576 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social149.png" alt="WBH16_Social149" width="457" height="586" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social149.png 457w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social149-234x300.png 234w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></a></p>
<p>Some drawings revealed that things got weird:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/AElegria/status/764592022254718976/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5577 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social150.png" alt="WBH16_Social150" width="455" height="481" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social150.png 455w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social150-284x300.png 284w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/Shuologist/status/765427895263043584/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5578 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social151.png" alt="WBH16_Social151" width="455" height="822" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social151.png 455w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social151-166x300.png 166w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social151-332x600.png 332w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></a></p>
<p>And apparently some events didn’t go at all as planned. Like when these two militant Red Cross workers forced another attendee to donate blood:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJDS1DID1b0/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5579 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social152.png" alt="WBH16_Social152" width="458" height="552" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social152.png 458w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social152-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></a></p>
<p>Or when these two chickens morphed into a person:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/kavi_melb/status/764365152699330560/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5580 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social153.png" alt="WBH16_Social153" width="457" height="744" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social153.png 457w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social153-184x300.png 184w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social153-369x600.png 369w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></a></p>
<p>Or when these six people forced a baby to dump his things in a river:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/toner_F/status/764551354266312704/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5581 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social154.png" alt="WBH16_Social154" width="457" height="504" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social154.png 457w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social154-272x300.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></a></p>
<p>Or when this happened:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJEmquMj2n0/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5582 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social155.png" alt="WBH16_Social155" width="459" height="553" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social155.png 459w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social155-249x300.png 249w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></a></p>
<p>And then there were some that are hard to describe. Like these solemn people underneath a large spoon holding a cherry:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/fackelmann/status/764644055422758913/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5583 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social156.png" alt="WBH16_Social156" width="476" height="789" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social156.png 476w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social156-181x300.png 181w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social156-362x600.png 362w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /></a></p>
<p>Or this zany man:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJDXO_FjtDp/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5584 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social157.png" alt="WBH16_Social157" width="458" height="568" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social157.png 458w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social157-242x300.png 242w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></a></p>
<p>Or these four psychos:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rurbinasal/status/764535917180755968/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5585 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social158.png" alt="WBH16_Social158" width="456" height="450" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social158.png 456w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social158-300x296.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></a></p>
<p>Or whatever the fuck is happening here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJFFKBqjEt-/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5586 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social159.png" alt="WBH16_Social159" width="459" height="567" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social159.png 459w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social159-243x300.png 243w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></a></p>
<p>But something the drawings did make clear is that a lot can happen in one night with a group of strangers:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/VaNikolidakis/status/764568012393422850/photo/1" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5587 size-full" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social160.png" alt="WBH16_Social160" width="456" height="596" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social160.png 456w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WBH16_Social160-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></a></p>
<p>Wait But Hi turned out to be a lot of things.</p>
<p>It was far from perfect. We were only able to set up events for 22% of the 16,000 people who applied. And there were mishaps—which people handled the best they could:</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to a third-degree avoidance mini-post! More on that <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/05/post-progress-meter.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p>I have a new word for you. Cluey. Let me explain.</p>
<p>My father once told me a mundane little anecdote from his youth. It involved his father—my late grandfather—and one of the happiest and most loving people I&#8217;ve ever known.</p>
<p>One weekend day, my grandfather went to the store and brought a new board game home for the family: Clue.</p>
<p>He excitedly asked my father and his sister (who were 7 and 9 at the time) if they wanted to play. They did. They joined him at the kitchen table as he opened up the game, read the instructions and explained to them how to play, divided up the cards and put all the pieces where they go.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to start, the doorbell rang. It was the neighbor kids, who said they were on their way outside to play some outdoor game they all used to play. Without a second thought, my dad and aunt jumped up from their seats and left with their friends.</p>
<p>A few hours later, they came back to the house. The game had been put back in the closet.</p>
<p>At the time, my dad didn&#8217;t think much of it—pretty normal day in their lives. But later on, he found himself remembering that day, and he always felt bad about it. He pictured his father sitting there at the table, now alone, with all the cards and pieces laid out. He pictured him waiting for a little while before accepting that it wasn&#8217;t gonna happen today, then collecting all the pieces and cards he had laid out, putting them back in the box, and putting the box back in the closet.</p>
<p>Pretty random story for my dad to tell me, right? The reason he did was because it was part of a conversation where I was trying to articulate a certain thing I suffer from, which is feeling <em>incredibly </em>bad for certain people in certain situations—situations in which the person I feel bad for was probably barely affected by what happened. It&#8217;s an odd feeling of intense heartbreaking compassion for people who didn&#8217;t actually go through anything especially bad.</p>
<p>When I explained this, my dad said, &#8220;I know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; and offered up the Clue story. Devastating. My grandfather had been <em>excited </em>about playing, and he was being such a <em>good, loving </em>dad, and he ended up <em>let down and disappointed</em>. He sat there <em>all by himself with the game board</em>, and finally he <em>put all the cards and pieces back in the box </em>because no, the game wasn&#8217;t happening anymore because <em>his kids would rather play with their friends than him. </em></p>
<p>My grandfather fought in World War II. He probably lost friends. He probably shot people. He might have been shot himself, who knows. But the image of him quietly putting all the Clue pieces back in the box? That&#8217;s not fucking okay. And now, thanks to my dad sharing this memory, I live every day haunted by this image:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5256" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1.png" alt="Stick figure putting Clue box back in the closet - clueyness" width="750" height="509" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1.png 1253w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-300x204.png 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-768x521.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-600x407.png 600w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-782x530.png 782w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-345x234.png 345w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Clueyness-1-103x70.png 103w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just my dad doing this to me. Tell me how I&#8217;m supposed to handle <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/paw-paw-why?utm_term=.xfn5KdaKx#.piQP9aK9q" target="_blank">this fucking story</a>, where <em>the grandfather made 12 burgers for six grandkids and only one showed up. </em></p>
<p>Full Clue situation. And the story includes literally the clueiest picture I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5243" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM.png" alt="papaw eating a hamburger alone" width="400" height="427" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM.png 990w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM-281x300.png 281w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM-768x821.png 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-30-at-3.07.05-PM-561x600.png 561w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>As I read the story, I started picturing this NICE FUCKING MAN buying all the ingredients in the grocery store, in a good mood with anticipation for the night, then coming home and making each of the 12 patties by hand—<em>maybe even adding carefully-thought-out spices into</em> <em>them</em>—toasting the buns, and timing everything to be done at just the right time. He even made <em>homemade ice cream.</em> Clue up the <em>dick</em>. It continues, if you imagine what happened at the end of the night. Either he wrapped up eight uneaten burgers, one by one, and put them in the fridge, ensuring that he&#8217;s later reminded of the rejection each time he heats one up to eat it, or, even worse, he just <em>threw them in the trash</em>.</p>
<p>The only thing that prevented me from taking my own life while reading the story is that the one granddaughter—bless her soul—showed up. Because just <em>imagine</em>.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lol/sad-papaw-ii-grandma-alone-art-show/" target="_blank">this 89-year-old grandmother</a>, who got <em><a href="https://twitter.com/Hablasian/status/728398280376258561/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">dressed nicely</a></em> and put her paintings up for display at an art showing, and guess what? No one fucking came. Then she packed up her paintings and drove home, feeling &#8220;foolish.&#8221; You know what that is? It&#8217;s cluey as shit. <em>Especially </em>her choice of the word foolish in particular. I really don&#8217;t need this in my life.</p>
<p>Movies know all about clueyness and use it to their advantage. Remember that super cluey old man neighbor in <em>Home Alone? </em>Who was so <em>nice and lonely and misunderstood? </em>The writers literally invented him to inflict clueyness on the audience so they could then release the burden of that clueyness at the end by showing him in happy reunion with his family. Cheapest trick in the book.</p>
<p>Clueyness doesn&#8217;t only apply to old people. One time about five years ago, I was in a shitty mood and in a rush when I hastily walked out of my apartment building. A FedEx man was standing outside the building with his cart of packages, and he wanted to get in so he could leave the packages on top of the communal mailbox (I assume the package recipient wasn&#8217;t home, so he had had no luck being buzzed in). As I walked out, he reached for the door as it closed behind me but it shut before he could grab it. After the door re-locked, he let out a frustrated exhale, and then he turned to me and asked, &#8220;Can you please open the door so I can drop these off?&#8221; I was already 10 steps away though, and late, so I said, &#8220;Sorry I can&#8217;t right now&#8221; and turned back towards where I was going. Before I did, I briefly saw his reaction to my refusal to help. He had the face on of a nice person who the world had been mean to all day. The snapshot of that dejected face he made bothered me more and more throughout the day, and now it&#8217;s five years later and <em>I still think about it. </em></p>
<p>If someone asks me what my biggest regret is, I have to lie, because how weird would it be if I answered, &#8220;The FedEx man incident. I&#8217;m a monster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clueyness is a strange phenomenon. My grandfather probably forgot about the Clue incident an hour after it happened. The FedEx man probably forgot about what I did to him five minutes later. I literally got cluey about a <em>dog </em>the other day, when he was super excited to play and I was busy and nudged him away with my foot and he looked at me <em>confused and taken aback</em><em> </em>and then went to the side of the room and laid down—and dogs aren&#8217;t even real. The weight of my heartache in these cases outweighs the actual tragedy like 10,000:1.</p>
<p>But knowing that it&#8217;s totally irrational doesn&#8217;t make clueyness any less excruciating—something I&#8217;m reminded of every time my night is ruined by post-Uber-ride-when-the-friendly-driver-tried-to-start-a-conversation-and-I-wasn&#8217;t-in-the-mood-so-I-gave-curt-answers-until-he-finally-got-the-hint-and-then-felt-embarrassed-and-stopped guilt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just destined for a life of feeling cluey about things. But at least I can take solace in a little headline I came across recently:</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to a new Wait But Why thing: the mailbag.</p>
<p>I get a lot of email from readers asking great questions, and there’s just not time to give most of them a proper answer. Unless, of course, I do a full post dedicated to those questions. So that’s what this is.</p>
<p>When the last post went out, I asked <a data-sumome-listbuilder-id="4171d68e-76b7-4053-afde-d702db0d891c">our email subscribers</a> to submit mailbag questions, and a lot of you responded. I can group the responses that came in into two categories:</p>
<p>1) Questions whose answers would be somewhere between one sentence and a few paragraphs</p>
<p>2) Questions whose answers would be somewhere between a few paragraphs and 30,000 words</p>
<p>The latter went into my Potential Future Posts List. The former were perfect for the mailbag.</p>
<p>For this mailbag, I started with 46 questions and saved the rest for future mailbags. Moving forward, you can submit a mailbag question anytime to <a href="mailto:mailbag@waitbutwhy.com">mailbag@waitbutwhy.com</a>.</p>
<p>Okay let&#8217;s jump in—</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Smooth or crunchy peanut butter?</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – <em>James T. (Adelaide, Australia)</em></span></p>
<p>Smooth. I have a jar of peanut butter and sometimes I take a big spoon of it and eat it, and the next 45 seconds of my life is chaotic and upsetting. Crunchy adds another factor on top of that situation, which is the last thing I need.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What do you think about <em>The Martian</em>? Do you like the book or movie better?</strong> </span>– <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Scott R. (Richmond, VA)</em></span></p>
<p>Book for sure. The movie was solid and enjoyable, but kind of just another pretty good movie. The book was special. It was one giant thought experiment that explored, “What would happen if a super-smart astronaut got stranded on Mars?” and you got the answer to the experiment told through the detailed, inner thoughts of the astronaut. I loved how many technical explanations there were in the book as Watney puzzled his way through problems, and the movie lost 90% of that aspect. In fairness, I read the book first and had no idea what was gonna happen, and I watched the movie without that suspense, so I’m not a fully fair judge.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What do you believe that not many other people do? (i.e., what are some of your unpopular opinions?)</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Jeremiah O. (New York, NY)</em></span></p>
<p>Saying you’re purely pro-life or purely pro-choice are both inane, for different reasons. A post on this is high up in the queue, so not gonna expand here. But that’s what I think.</p>
<p>Being inside is better than being outside in not all but most cases.</p>
<p>The longer the plane ride, the better. Plane rides are the best—as long as I don&#8217;t have to work or have to sleep.</p>
<p>Great music without lyrics is better than great music with lyrics.</p>
<p>Black licorice is delicious.</p>
<p>Chocolate is a bad flavor of ice cream.</p>
<p>Animated TV or movies are more fun to watch than real people TV or movies.</p>
<p>Washing your hair every day is a silly thing to do.</p>
<p>Ordering fish in a restaurant is for people who don&#8217;t care about happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Would you call yourself a transhumanist? </span></strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">– </span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Saurabh S. (New Delhi, India)</em></span></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure what a transhumanist is. Hold on.</p>
<p>Okay Wikipedia says it’s this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Transhumanism is an international and intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and creating widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities. Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. The most common thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.</em></p>
<p>Uh, yeah, definitely. The objectives of transhumanism strike me as the kind of thing a lot of people think is wrong or distasteful or unnatural&#8230;until it becomes commonplace. And then people can&#8217;t imagine what life was like before and would <em>never </em>want to go back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always in favor of getting rid of what&#8217;s &#8220;natural&#8221; for something that&#8217;s better. Sleeping in caves is natural, and it&#8217;s really great that we found a better way. Riding horses is how humans got around for a long time, and driving cars is a huge upgrade for both the human and the horse. I&#8217;m sure people thought the concept of the organ transplant was terribly unnatural before the technology became possible, and now they don&#8217;t. So yeah, let&#8217;s go for it. I&#8217;m not at all attached to the biological body I was born with if we can find a better way.</p>
<p>That said, at some point you start running into the question <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html" target="_blank">&#8220;what makes you you?&#8221;</a> I&#8217;ll upgrade any part of my existence in any way available until it gets to the point where doing so kills me by making me not me anymore. If science can replace my brain with a synthetic brain containing the identical data as my own, with the advantage that it&#8217;ll never age, it sounds great—unless I suspect that the new me seems like me and acts like me but <em>I </em>don&#8217;t actually have access to that consciousness. When an upgrade gets to the point where it&#8217;s essentially creating a synthetic clone of me to take my place in the world—that&#8217;s right where my transhumanism ends. The exception might be if I was going to die either way and creating the upgraded no-longer-me clone me can serve people on Earth somehow, like someone creating a clone of themselves so their family doesn&#8217;t have to lose them.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know when an upgrade causes you to cease to exist because there&#8217;s no clear answer to what makes you you. But we&#8217;re a long way from crossing that bridge, so for now, I&#8217;m pro-transhumanism.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Will you ever finish up the presidents series?</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">– <em>Jennifer R. (Davis, CA)<br />
– Danielle P. (Arlington, VA)<br />
<em>– </em>Emily B. (Arlington, VA)<br />
<em>– </em>Ron G. (San Marcos, CA)<br />
<em>– </em>Claire L. (Cape Cod, MA)</em></span></p>
<p>I know, I know, and I haven’t forgotten about it. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/american-presidents-washington-lincoln.html" target="_blank">The presidents series</a> <em>will </em>be completed, probably with two more parts, but I don&#8217;t have a specific timeline yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Do you know how to code? Or are you planning to learn it?</strong></span> – <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dawid P. (Sufczyn, Poland)</span></em></p>
<p>No. But I do know BC Calculus, thank god, because the American public school curriculum was last updated in 1820.</p>
<p>Part of me thinks it&#8217;s a no-brainer time investment to learn to code, but part of me also wonders if we might be in a phase of time when it&#8217;s an important skill to have, but then that phase ends. There was a time when it was important for computer people to know how to actually use 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s and now there&#8217;s no need for that, so maybe people who are being born now will never need to learn how to code? I&#8217;d prefer that narrative, because it would mean A) it excuses me from having to deal with learning how to code, and B) I only made a dramatic two-decade mistake by not learning how to code in college and not a lifelong one.</p>
<p>I should probably learn how to code.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why did you decide to buy a tortoise?</span> </strong>– <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Samantha K. (Singapore)</span></em></p>
<p>In 2005, I went to the pet store to get a fighter fish because why not have a little screensaver on your desk. When I got there, I walked by a glass terrarium with a golf-ball-sized tortoise in it. I asked to hold him immediately, lifting him up by pinching his shell between my thumb and index finger. His four legs moved back and forth as he tried to figure out why he was suddenly levitating in mid-air. And the decision was done.</p>
<p>11 years later, Winston and I live happily together. As I type this, he (now the size of a football) is moseying by me, going about his business, living his life.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure why everyone doesn’t own a tortoise. They’re hilarious entities, they’re unthinkably cute, they’re unbelievably chill and require very little from you, they’re a great party trick when you have friends over, and they won’t expire until your grandkids are in their 80s.</p>
<p>I mean:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What would you do if you could meet antimatter Tim?</span> </strong>– <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Treyvon C. (Houston, TX)</span></em></p>
<p>Thanks, Treyvon, for sending me on an hour spiral reading about antimatter and what happens when you combine it with matter.</p>
<p>Here’s the deal. Antimatter is matter made up of antiparticles, which are like normal particles except with the opposite charge—negatively charged protons, positively charged electrons, etc.</p>
<p>Antimatter occurs very rarely in nature and is incredibly hard to produce—so hard that in 1999, NASA <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/prop12apr99_1/" target="_blank">estimated</a> that the going rate for antimatter was about $62.5 trillion per gram. A later <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/antimatter_spaceship.html" target="_blank">estimate</a> in 2006 brought the price down to only $25 billion a gram nbd.</p>
<p>I weigh about 160 lbs or about 73 kg. So at the cheapest, anti-matter Tim would be worth about $1,825,000,000,000,000 and would be getting mugged constantly.</p>
<p>But if he managed to make it intact to a meeting with me, it would be fun to meet him until we shook hands and the Earth blew up.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: when matter and antimatter are put together, both of them are annihilated and a lot of energy is released. How much energy? E = mc<sup>2</sup><sub>  </sub>much. That example—a gram of antimatter and a gram of matter colliding—comes out like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Mass = 2 grams in this case, and c = the speed of light in meters/second = about 300,000,000 m/s, so:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E = (.002 kg)(300,000,000)<sup>2</sup></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">E = 1.8 x 10<sup>14</sup><sub>  </sub>joules</p>
<p>1 kg of TNT releases 4,184,000 joules of energy. So our gram of antimatter collision produces an explosion equivalent to blowing up about 43 million kg of TNT.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">= 43,000 tons of TNT<br />
= 43 kilotons of TNT<br />
= an explosion about three times bigger than the Hiroshima bomb</p>
<p>And that’s a <em>gram </em>of antimatter.</p>
<p>Back to my hangout with antimatter Tim. He and I each weigh about 73,000 grams, so our handshake would be unpleasant for both of us, blowing us both up in an explosion that releases the same energy as 3.1 million kilotons, or 3,100 <em>mega</em>tons of TNT. (A megaton = a million tons = a billion kgs)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene" target="_blank">density of TNT</a> is 1.654 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. So a kg of TNT would be about the size of a grapefruit, a ton of TNT would be a little smaller than a car, a kiloton of TNT would be the size of a house, and my handshake with antimatter Tim would be like blowing up a cube of TNT with a side of 1.2 km. Very similar, it turns out, to what I <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/7-3-billion-people-one-building.html" target="_blank">once figured out</a> was the size of the building needed to hold all the world’s humans:</p>
<p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TNT-cube-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5173" src="https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TNT-cube-2.jpg" alt="TNT cube 2" width="700" height="431" srcset="https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TNT-cube-2.jpg 1500w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TNT-cube-2-300x185.jpg 300w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TNT-cube-2-768x473.jpg 768w, https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TNT-cube-2-600x369.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>It wouldn’t quite blow up the Earth, but with an explosion 200,000 times the size of the Hiroshima bomb, me meeting antimatter Tim would be bad for everybody.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Do you have any insights as to how one finds their calling?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Akshat V. (Bangalore, India)</em></span></p>
<p>Say two people want to find the love of their life, Person A and Person B.</p>
<p>Person A never goes on dates, opting instead to sit alone debating in her head about who the exact kind of person is she will fall in love with. She scours online profiles, but never contacts anyone. Instead, her plan is to wait until she comes across the profile so perfect for her that she’ll know she’s found The One. Then and only then will she reach out to that person for a date.</p>
<p>Person B goes on a lot of dates, constantly meeting new people and keeping an open mind, because she knows she probably doesn’t know either herself or the type of match that makes sense for her as well as she thinks she does.</p>
<p>Who’s more likely to find the love of their life?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Can you suggest [legal] ways to experience Whoa moments?</strong> </span>– <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Tóth B.</span></em></p>
<p>Psychedelic methods aside, I’d say this:</p>
<p>The best way <em>not</em> to experience a <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html" target="_blank">whoa moment</a> is to live your days exactly how you normally do. You know how when you brush your teeth, you can think about something totally different and it doesn’t affect your ability to brush? Because it’s all being done by your subconscious? Well living your normal routine day is kind of like that—your brain is mostly on autopilot, and you&#8217;re living largely in an unconscious and comfortable groove.</p>
<p>To bring heightened clarity and new epiphanies into your life, try getting out of that unconscious groove by forcing conscious thought about things our consciousness doesn&#8217;t usually bother with because they&#8217;re not important for our daily tasks. I did this recently when I found myself with 15 minutes to kill on a street corner before meeting someone there. Instead of doing what I&#8217;d normally do—burying myself in my phone to pass the time—I decided to get into &#8220;conscious mode.&#8221; I looked up and around me at the architecture, I looked at little details on the sidewalk and the steps of a nearby building, I looked down at my feet and realized it was funny that I was supporting myself vertically on two sticks. And suddenly, everything was weird, and I was having a great time. It was hilarious watching all these people bustling around, all of them on their own two sticks, all of them stuck to the side of a floating rock in space, and none of them thinking about that. Full whoa moment.</p>
<p>But the people I was watching weren&#8217;t thinking about being stuck to the side of a rock floating in a huge void—they were completely lost in the unconscious groove we all spend most of our time in.</p>
<p>A whoa moment happens when your conscious mind takes a step back and glimpses reality for a second, which we all have the power to do—we just have to remember to think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">___________</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Have you ever been to Burning Man? If so, how was your experience? If not, why not?</span></strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Sam B. (Kansas City, MO)</em></span></p>
<p>Funny you ask. I’m going this year for the first time—at least that’s the plan (I’ve failed so far at getting tickets). I’ve heard about Burning Man a lot, but it always struck me as something very not me-ish to go to. Without really knowing what Burning Man is, I&#8217;ve always just pictured a bunch of people standing in the 120º desert acting exactly like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad3TwRtPvfU" target="_blank">this woman</a>, except with no stage or music nearby. And what the hell am I gonna do in that situation. Also very unclear why that video has so many views.</p>
<p>But over the past few years, I’ve heard so many people say so many fascinating things about it that I&#8217;ve become enticed enough to give it a try. Any advice from Burning Man veterans is welcome.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">___________</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What kind of kid were you?</span></strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Mia (Uppsala, Sweden)</em></span></p>
<p>I said a lot of words. I actually made what I now realize was the world’s first podcast in 1987 when I was five. I had this little tape-player/recorder and I’d regularly put a blank tape in and press record and say some shit for a half hour. Then I’d write “Tim’s Performance” on the tape and give it to my parents to enjoy. At one point, I suspected they were lying about actually listening to my musings, so I tested them by waiting until about 20 minutes into one of my recording sessions and then saying, “The secret number is 128. I’m going to ask you what the secret number is later, and remember, it’s 128.” I later asked my parents what the secret number was and they didn’t know what the fuck I was talking about. My podcast was not engaging.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What is one thing that you don&#8217;t procrastinate about and why do you think that is?</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> – <em>Richard R. (Fort Lauderdale, FL)</em></span></p>
<p>I had to think about this for an upsettingly long time to come up with an answer. What I finally came up with is eating my gummy vitamins each day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">___________</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What&#8217;s a recent embarrassing YouTube spiral you&#8217;ve gone down? </strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">– Jackie V. (Perth, Australia)</span></em></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Has your sense of life purpose changed with a newfound look on human mortality? If so, how? If not, why?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Will H. (Berkeley, CA)</em></span></p>
<p>For those unacquainted, I believe Will is referring to the fact that I started Wait But Why 100% sure I was going to die somewhere between 2013 and 2100, and then I wrote posts like the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" target="_blank">Fermi</a> post and the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html" target="_blank">AI</a> post and the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html" target="_blank">Truthism</a> post and the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html" target="_blank">Cryonics</a> post and now I have no idea what the fuck is going on. Suddenly, the prospect of living till I’m an ultra-cranky 1,280-year-old seems perfectly plausible.</p>
<p>I’m not sure my life purpose has changed because I’m not sure I had a life purpose in mind to begin with. But it’s definitely put me in a better mood about things. An atheist is already at rock bottom when it comes to their personal long-term outlook, so realizing that the world of 2050 might be unrecognizable to us, with totally different rules, is a delightful development.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">___________</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Do you have any recurring nightmares? </strong><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">– Daniel J. (Cape Town, South Africa)</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yes. About really big numbers. It&#8217;s me somewhere, in the shit, while some huge booming voice is telling me I have to do stuff involving huge numbers like a billion and a trillion. It goes all the way back to when I was a kid. I just got the shivers writing this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_____________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What are your MBTI results?<br />
</strong></span><strong>As one of the many (I&#8217;m assuming here) people out there who read snippets of your posts to an unreceptive spouse, I&#8217;m wondering if there are clusters of Myers &amp; Briggs personality types that find your writing particularly appealing. So, I would really enjoy the following: (1)</strong><strong> Your MBTI results, (2) The results of a survey of your email subscribers, and (3) Your thoughts on the whole thing.</strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Preston S. (Oklahoma City, OK)</em></span></p>
<p>For those unacquainted, Myers Briggs is a famous personality test that labels everyone with a four-letter code. It judges personalities on a set of four binary criteria. As explained by the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/" target="_blank">Myers Briggs website</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><u>Favorite world</u></em><em>: Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or on your own inner world? This is called <strong>Extraversion (E)</strong> or<strong> Introversion (I)</strong>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><u>Information</u></em><em>: Do you prefer to focus on the basic information you take in or do you prefer to interpret and add meaning? This is called <strong>Sensing (S)</strong> or <strong>Intuition (N)</strong>.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What are your thoughts on routine infant circumcision, beneficial procedure or human rights violation?</strong> </span>– <em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Beau S. (Brisbane, Australia)</span></em></p>
<p>If I take a step back and look at this from first principles, I start by looking up whether the procedure is important for health reasons. When I find out the answer is probably not, it becomes pretty clear that circumcision is nothing other than a primitive, religious practice of genital mutilation that for some reason is common today. It makes no sense, and once we all stop doing it, it’ll seem like an absurd custom of the past. I had friends recently go through this decision with their new baby, and every argument went against circumcision except one: not circumcising their son would make him different than most of the other guys in his world in a part of life where being different can be mortifying, especially as either a little kid being made fun of by his friends or an already-sexually-insecure teenager. They went with circumcision. And I get it. But it makes no sense, aside from the fact that we’re all doing it (at least in the US). Can we just all agree to stop it with new babies?</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do you like waffles?</span> </strong>– <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Matt V. (Bartonsville, PA)</em></span></p>
<p>I’ve never understood waffles / pancakes / french toast people. A few bites of that on the side, sure, but if I’m hungry at a breakfast restaurant, I want something that involves salt and tabasco sauce. Ordering those sweet things for breakfast seems to me like ordering cake for dinner.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What are some of your favorite movies, and what do you think they say about you?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Joe S.</em></span></p>
<p>As I thought about the answer to this question, I realized that the movies I’ve liked the absolute most in my life were movies made for 7-10-year olds when I was 7-10. The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Home Alone, The Princess Bride, Back to the Future, etc. Are those movies all incredible, or does this just always happen with whatever happened to be the best movies of your childhood? Not really sure.</p>
<p>For movies I’ve seen from the age of 10 onwards, I’ll give some awards:</p>
<p><strong>Most obvious answer that’s also just really good though: </strong>The Shawshank Redemption (Runners-up: Godfather 1/2, Braveheart)</p>
<p><strong>Less obvious answer that should be more obvious and I’m not sure why it’s not everyone’s favorite movie: </strong>Shutter Island</p>
<p><strong>Movie that is considered good but I probably liked it more than most people cause it was exactly my type of fun plot: </strong>Memento</p>
<p><strong>Movie that’s pretty random to put on this list but I just really liked it:</strong> About Schmidt</p>
<p><strong>Movie I thought was only pretty good but then it stuck with me way more than I realized it would and sometimes makes me wonder if I’m Truman and this thing is happening to me and having me seeing <em>The Truman Show </em>was a really intense, fun part of the plot for everyone watching: </strong>The Truman Show</p>
<p><strong>Most fun movie-watching experience even though I wouldn’t really call it a great movie: </strong>Ocean’s 11 (Runner-up: Limitless)</p>
<p><strong>Movie whose first 70% makes this list but not the last 30% because that part sucked: </strong>Minority Report</p>
<p><strong>Movie that I loved and took fully seriously and then saw again with people who were laughing the whole time and realized it was actually a comedy: </strong>Being John Malkovich. (Runner-up: American Psycho)</p>
<p><strong>Movie that’s not considered very good but I actually think it was great: </strong>The Invention of Lying</p>
<p><strong>Movie that might have been great but also it might have been terrible and I don’t know because I don’t know what the fuck happened: </strong>Mulholland Drive</p>
<p><strong>Documentary that was a terrible experience to watch the entire time but also the best documentary I’ve ever seen: </strong>Dear Zachary</p>
<p><strong>Documentary that was almost as good and it wasn&#8217;t a nightmare to watch: </strong>March of the Penguins</p>
<p><strong>Documentary that’s comforting as fuck to watch and I’ve seen it three times and there will be more viewings in the future: </strong>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</p>
<p><strong>Movie that I think about every time I see a person yelling things to no one on the street: </strong>Requiem for a Dream</p>
<p><strong>Movie that was incredibly good and also, kill me:</strong> Life is Beautiful</p>
<p><strong>Movie that is objectively pretty great but it also kind of annoys me how “cool” it is: </strong>Every Quentin Tarantino movie (Runner-up: Every Stanley Kubrik movie)</p>
<p><strong>Movie that ruined my happiness permanently: </strong>The Ring</p>
<p><strong>Movie that’s embarrassing to put on this list but sorry it was just really good: </strong>Love Actually. (Runner-up: Titanic)</p>
<p><strong>Worst movie I’ve ever seen:</strong> American Wedding. (Runner-up: From Hell. And Dodgeball. And Transformers 2. And Next Friday.)</p>
<p>One thing about this list is there are very few comedies. It’s not that I never like comedies—I just think comedy movies are rarely <em>that </em>funny. I can’t think of many movies that can equal the funniness of the funniest TV shows—shows like The Office (UK), Curb, It’s Always Sunny, Family Guy, etc.</p>
<p>As for what these say about me? I don’t really know—that&#8217;s for Joe to decide.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Has your curiosity ever been a problem for you?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Mariam C. (Paris, France)</em></span></p>
<p>My most prominent emotion when traveling in other countries (or in parts of the US I’m not used to) is curiosity. That’s part of why I often pick destinations that I don’t know much about or that seem super different from my world.</p>
<p>The most interesting experiences happen when I befriend locals, which usually allows me to get a much deeper glimpse into what life is like in that place than I ever could as a voyeuring tourist. I’ve gotten myself invited into homes, weddings, social events, factories, etc.—and it’s usually a great experience.</p>
<p>Usually.</p>
<p>On one of my solo trips, I was out in the Rio nightlife district of Lapa and met two extraordinarily friendly dudes. They really liked me, so much that they invited me to a nearby house party.</p>
<p>A random Brazilian house party! I had no idea what a Brazilian house party was like, and I was super excited to find out. Luckily for me, I had found two guys who just really like befriending random foreign dudes and bringing them to parties.</p>
<p>Then we went to the party, which turned out to be us standing on a silent street a few blocks away from the crowded area while they forcefully took my things and ran away. Interesting party, but they had a better time than I did.</p>
<p>Hilariously, I had taken a selfie with them earlier in the night when we were all still BFFs. It was on a disposable camera, and that was one of the things they decided not to bother taking, so I still have the picture.</p>

<p>Kind of funny looking at their faces and knowing now that the smiles were, “Oh god yes I think this guy’s actually gonna come with us!”</p>
<p>One other example that came to mind is the time I was about 12 and got curious about what would happen if I put my hamster, Waddles Urban, up my dad’s t-shirt when he was lying on his back on the couch sleeping. It was a very bad experience for both my dad and Waddles and a terrific one for me—kind of the reverse of the Brazil incident.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Would anything ever change your opinion about the existence of God? Would you discount it as a psychological error or hallucination? Could anything ever prove the existence of God to you?</span> – </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Michael S.</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why don&#8217;t you believe in God?</span> – </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Luis C. (Dallas, TX)</em></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How can you be 100% sure that there isn&#8217;t something deeper to life than the material realm?</span> – </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Noli S. (Prishtina, Kosovo)</em></span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to everything written in the Bible, Quran, Torah, Vedas, Guru Granth Sahib, and all the rest, I’m atheist for the same reason I’m atheist about Greek Myths when I read them—they were written by people a long time ago who knew less than we do about the world, not more. No, lightning isn’t caused by Zeus throwing lightning bolts, it&#8217;s caused by the interaction of oppositely-charged particles in heavy clouds. And no, ancient rocks and fossils and mountains and canyons weren’t created by a great flood 6,000 years ago, they were created by a bunch of other stuff that happened over the past five billion years—stuff that we now understand. So when it comes to the various gods described in the world’s religions—yes, I’m as atheist as can be. With those gods, the question isn’t “Why don’t I believe in God?” it’s “Why <em>would </em>I believe in God?”</p>
<p>That said, when it comes to the question, “Is there a higher force or higher being or grand creator of some kind?” I’m entirely agnostic. We don’t even know if we’re alone in the universe or not—as far as we know, there are trillions of superintelligent civilizations out there, with capabilities we couldn’t understand even if they tried to explain it to us (could you explain human capabilities to a chicken?). Could one of them have created life on Earth in some lab? Sure, why not?</p>
<p>Could it be that it’s common for higher civilizations to create simulations, and if so, wouldn’t that mean that they might create trillions upon trillions of them, and if so, wouldn’t that mean that there are far more simulation civilizations in existence than real ones, and if so, wouldn’t that mean that just by the percentages, it’s far more likely that we’re one of the simulated ones than one of the real ones? Uh…I guess yeah?<a href="#footnote2-1-5151" id="note2-1-5151" rel="footnote2">1</a>
<p>We don’t even know what the universe <em>is</em>. It might be one of hundreds or millions or an infinite number of universes, or it might be the only thing there is. It might be a blip of energy floating around in one of the quarks inside one of the atoms that makes up the toenail of a red and blue baby pig bathing himself in a five-dimensional jelly swamp, and it comes into and out of existence in a nanosecond of the piglet’s life since every second in his world is 10<sup><span style="font-size: 9pt;">10</span><sup><span style="font-size: 7pt;">925</span></sup></sup> years for us. That literally might be what’s happening. It’s as likely as anything else you can come up with.</p>
<p>So it’s outrageous to declare anything about the origin of life, the existence of one or more higher beings, or what our place is in all of this other than “I don’t know.” Agnostic.</p>
<p>And when any fellow human—in 2016 or in 100 A.D.—declares that he knows the deal with God, including a bunch of details, I immediately say “Nope.”</p>
<p>I think that answers Luis and Noli. As for Michael—the answer is yes. I know what I know because of the information I have. If new information presents itself to me, it might change what I believe. But even if some rad supernatural shit happened like some woman levitated on the sidewalk when I walked by and then suddenly went shooting upwards through the clouds, I’d be quicker to assume that it was the work of a biological or AI being from another part of the universe, or that we were in a simulation and the beings running it got bored and decided to fuck with me, than I would be to take what I saw as evidence that one of the Earthly religions was true.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Would you rather be attacked by 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?</strong> </span>– <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Kyle P. (Cheshire, CT)</em></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this.</p>
<p>I’d go for the 100 little horses. Here’s why:</p>
<p>The duck would be <em>terrifying</em>. Have you seen how ducks act when you throw a piece of bread in the water? They turn into ravenous psychos. They use their wings, beaks, feet, and anything else they can to violently knock the other ducks out of the way. Then they <em>lunge </em>at the bread with their big hard duck beak. Now imagine a huge duck and <em>you’re </em>the bread. You’re done. That cock will charge at you and try to bite your head off. And you can’t run away—because it can <em>fly</em>. And its beak is still narrow enough that if you try to hide somewhere it can probably wedge its beak in there and pull you out. You’re done. It’s over.</p>
<p>The horses would be bad. But not as bad as the duck. Angry horses are pretty angry. And their bite could probably take a chunk out of your leg. Or maybe they’d kick you with their hind legs, which would give you painful little ankle bruises. All of that would be painful, but not lethal. Lethal happens when you’re frantically kicking them one by one and you accidentally fall over. Falling over would be a huge disaster with the little horses. They’d be biting your neck open and kicking you in the crotch and jumping up on your stomach. Done. But unlike with the duck, you could probably escape the horses. You could just climb up on a bench and now what? They’re screwed. They can charge the bench and jump up on their hind legs all they want, but you’re a full foot above their highest jump, and they can’t climb or fly, so you can just lay down and nap on the bench while they tire themselves out. Then when you wake up, you can carefully grab them one at a time and bring it up to the bench and use its tail to tie its back legs together, neutralizing that horse. It would take a while, but eventually they’d all be neutralized, hobbling around on the ground, in the shit with their leg situation, and you could just step over them and walk away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why does the atmosphere of the earth circle around the earth? We circle with the earth because we are attached to the ground, but the atmosphere isn&#8217;t attached to the ground so why does it circle around with the planet?</span></strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Sinan A. (Baghdad, Iraq)</em></span></p>
<p>You say “we circle the earth because we are attached to the ground,” but what does “attached” mean? What it really means is there’s friction between our bodies and the surface of the earth that “pulls” our bodies. The oceans are less “attached” to the ground than a solid human body, but oceans rotate with the earth too, because there’s friction between the water molecules and the ocean floor. There’s less friction between the atmosphere and Earth’s surface than there is in the case of solid or liquid matter on the surface, but there’s still friction—which affects the atmosphere enough to pull it, too, along with Earth’s rotation.</p>
<p>But in all of these cases, friction is only why these things <em>initially</em> began to rotate along with the earth. Once something is up to full Earth rotational speed, the reason the atmosphere or anything else continues to rotate with the earth is inertia—an object in motion stays in motion. If the earth suddenly and instantly reversed rotational direction, there would be utter chaos on the surface, and everything would go flying. We, the oceans, and the atmosphere would all still carry the normal rotational velocity and the earth no longer would—kind of like when a moving car slams on the breaks and everything in the car lunges forward. But once the chaos settled down, the rotational velocity of all things on Earth’s surface would eventually be slowed down and reversed to match Earth’s new spin—because of friction. You’d be dead though.</p>

<p>This warrants a 12,000-word post, but for now, I’ll start with one idea:</p>
<p>I think a great way to be a good person is to get in the habit of consciously thinking about the fact that almost every stranger, co-worker, friend, acquaintance, fling, customer service representative, driver, waiter, customer, client, neighbor, and person on the internet you come across:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a family who loves them and vice versa</li>
<li>Has hopes and dreams and regrets and frustrations</li>
<li>Has as many thoughts going through their head at all times as you do</li>
<li>Is dealing with random health problems, trying to make ends meet financially, and is probably tired</li>
<li>Might be supporting one or more other human beings</li>
<li>Might be just a little sad all the time about a tragedy in their past</li>
<li>Might be the most important person in someone else’s life</li>
<li>Is just trying to figure out how to be happy</li>
</ul>
<p>i.e. They’re a full human just like you.</p>
<p>Remembering that will make you kinder and more empathetic.</p>

<p>My sister had a blanket she was obsessed with as a toddler that she inexplicably called her Ninee (like “night” without the t and then “knee”). If you tried to take her Ninee away from her she flipped her shit. It was a critical part of her being.</p>
<p>My thermos is my Ninee. My ideal way to drink coffee is to slowly have one 16-ounce cup of black coffee over a four-hour span. Coffee in an open mug stays hot for like eight minutes. In a covered, paper take-out cup, maybe 15 minutes. Both totally unacceptable. I suffered for my whole life with this issue until I realized thermoses existed a few years ago. I got <a href="http://amzn.to/1W36cpp" target="_blank">this one</a> and it solved all my problems, with the added benefit of it being closable, so I can pop a full thermos in my bag or put it on the floor on an airplane (upright in my shoe).</p>
<p>Because I’m a child, I lose my thermos by leaving it somewhere about twice a year on average, but at $22, it’s only a little devastating every time it happens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also recently gotten into the <a href="http://www.swellbottle.com/product/thermo-vacuum-insulated-reusable-water-bottle-shimmer-collection-silver-lining/?size=9oz" target="_blank">small S’well thermos</a>, which I use when I don’t have my bag because unlike my normal one, it fits in my jeans pocket.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure those absurd stage hypnosis charades with a bunch of “hypnotized” people barking like a dog or having an orgasm or forgetting the number two on stage in front of a laughing crowd have to be some combo of people enjoying attention, peer pressure, and some element of placebo effect. No way that can be real.</p>
<p>But serious, one-on-one hypnotherapy? Sure, why not? The brain is weird, so why wouldn’t a trance-like state be able to be induced? From what I’ve read, hypnosis is just an extension of the phenomenon of a person getting so wrapped up in a thought that when someone calls their name, they don’t even hear it. That kind of hypnosis seems to be real, though it works on some people better than others and for some not at all. The problem for the credibility of hypnosis is all the fictional, cartoony hypnosis we’ve seen in movies, where the person is a robot who will do whatever the hypnotist says—pretty sure it doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>I have a friend who’s been doing a type of hypnosis called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing" target="_blank">EMDR</a> with his therapist and claims that while doing so, a memory of <em>himself breastfeeding</em> flashed in his consciousness for a second. Nahhh, right? Or could it be possible?</p>

<p>One thing that will never be a problem for me is a shortage of post topics. I currently have a 116-page Word document full of topics, thoughts, questions, and random brainstorms I want to make into posts. Whenever I’m in an interesting conversation, or think of a funny observation, or find myself with an intriguing question, I write it in the doc. And if you just get in that habit, the potential-post-topic doc becomes long pretty quickly. To make it into the doc, a topic generally has to satisfy at least one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s something I think people know about and hear about but generally don’t understand</li>
<li>It’s something about life we all notice subconsciously but we don’t usually think about it or put it into words</li>
<li>It’s something that many of us are feeling or thinking secretly but no one is saying</li>
<li>It’s something important that we don’t think about very intelligently because we don’t have a useful framework in our heads, or an important psychological concept that we should have a concrete label for but don’t</li>
<li>It’s something I come across that blows my mind and I know it’ll blow readers’ minds too</li>
</ul>
<p>When it&#8217;s time to start a new post, I scan down the big doc and pick something that excites me at that time. I get really exhausted by a topic by the time I&#8217;m done with it, so I try to mix things up—if the last post was really researchy, the next one might be more brainstormy, or if the last topic was heavy, I might pick something lighter next.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What do I do if I always feel stupid?</span></strong><br />
<strong>There are so many awesome things in our world, e.g. gravitational astronomy, physics of superconducters, neuroscience, genetics, AI, space exploration, math problems, WBW posts. Well, you get it. Much more than an average person could ever learn, I guess. Therefore my question is: what do I do if I always feel stupid? Like, really, always.</strong> –<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> Katie S. (Russia)</em></span></p>
<p>Stupid is when you don’t know that much about anything and you feel like everyone else does. The good news is, everyone else doesn’t. At all. The world is full of exciting, complex things that almost no one understands. Once you realize this, all the stuff you don’t know isn’t upsetting, it’s <em>exciting</em>.</p>
<p>It’s like reading. I’ve read a bunch of good books, but there are 1,000 times as many that I haven’t read. If I believed that most people had read most books and for some reason I had not, I’d feel embarrassingly not-well-read. But because I know that most people haven’t read most books, I can take my own situation out of the thought process and just enjoy the fact that I’ll never run out of good new books to read.</p>
<p>So even though people sometimes present themselves as more knowledgeable about more things than they really are, remember that really, most people don’t know much about anything, and try to get excited about the fact that with every year of your life that goes by, you’ll know more and more and more.</p>
<p>And remember, to actually learn about a topic you don&#8217;t get, you have to build a tree trunk foundation of understanding before you can start tacking onto that foundation by adding on branches and leaves (like news articles about recent developments). The thing that makes people feel stupid is trying to absorb branches and leaves when they don&#8217;t yet have a tree trunk, so it always goes in one ear and out the other and you feel like it&#8217;s hopeless for you to ever grasp the topic—but it&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Cooking some elaborate thing using a recipe is for me like reading fiction—when I do it, I thoroughly enjoy it, but I do it like once a year. Mostly, I keep it to things like stir frying vegetables and rice, which is an excuse to have a condiment/spices party.</p>
<p>As for cookbooks, I recently got J. Kenji Lopez-Alt’s <a href="http://amzn.to/1SE5cEB" target="_blank">The Food Lab</a>, which is delightful so far.

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How does wind work? What is the mechanism behind wind happening? Why does it happen?</strong> </span>–<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> Steven H. (Cape Girardeau, MO)</em></span></p>
<p>I’ll need to read about how weather works for 30 hours before I can give a proper answer to this question, but I’ll take a crack.</p>
<p>The key to wind is air <em>pressure</em>. Forget the atmosphere for a second and take a breath in. What happens? Air from outside your body rushes into your body. Now exhale—and air rushes back out. What’s happening is that the air outside your body is staying at the same pressure level, but when you inhale, you’re increasing the volume in your lungs, which lowers the air molecules / volume ratio in your lungs, which lowers the air pressure in your lungs. Air always “wants” to <em>even </em>things out, so air rushes into your lungs to accommodate for the extra space created by your inhale and equalize the pressure inside and outside of you. When you exhale, you’re decreasing the volume in your lungs, which increases the air pressure to a level higher than the air outside your body, so air rushes out to make things equal.</p>
<p>When the sun heats up parts of the atmosphere, the air rises, which leaves less air down near the surface than normal—a low pressure system. Hot air rising and leaving a void underneath is kind of like the atmosphere “inhaling.” Just like what happens in your expanding lungs, air from higher pressure systems surrounding the low pressure system rushes in to equalize things—i.e. the low pressure area “sucks” in surrounding air. In the reverse situation, when there’s a higher-than-normal pressure system in the atmosphere, it’s like a human exhaling. The higher pressure system presses outward into lower pressure areas and the air rushes there to equalize things. That rushing air is what we experience as wind. Wind is just air moving from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What’s one of the most important life lessons you&#8217;ve learned in your years so far that you would give to a young adult/college student?</span></strong> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Cathy J. (Toronto, Canada)</em></span></p>
<p>Making really close lifelong friends is a hard thing to do for most people, and it gets even harder once you hit the real world and everyone lives in isolated apartments and spends their days at work. Really close friendships are built by spending a ton of hours with the same person or group of people again and again, and there’s nowhere better to foster that than college or the years after college when people often live with roommates.</p>
<p>Given that, one piece of advice would be to first, assess your friendships and figure out who’s in Q1 (<a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Graph.png" target="_blank">here’s a refresher</a> on what Q1 is, from <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html" target="_blank">this post</a>).</p>
<p>Then, invest in those friendships, and remember that lazy afternoons sitting around doing nothing with them might seem mundane, but it’s actually building a foundation of closeness and comfort that you’ll be thankful for later. It’s time well spent.</p>
<p>And if you don’t think many of your friends are in Q1, ask yourself why that might be. Maybe you’re not hanging out with the right kind of people for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">___________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Can you share any advice on becoming a good writer?</strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>James M. (Dublin, Ireland)</em></span></p>
<p>1) Write. I wrote 300 blog posts between the ages of 23 and 29 before starting Wait But Why. It can take a while to find your voice and your tone and your style. At the beginning, you’ll be all over the place, the same way you are when you try a new sport or video game or musical instrument. That’s good—you’re experimenting on a canvas. Don’t judge your own writing at this phase—you’re experimenting and searching and playing—you’re not doing your best writing yet. If your <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html" target="_blank">mammoth</a> is freaking out too much and ruining things, start with an anonymous blog.</p>
<p>2) Don’t be a complete perfectionist, but don’t settle for writing you know isn’t working. Even if you’re experimenting, if something you’re trying isn’t working, try to figure out why, rewrite parts, start over and try a new approach, etc.—keep fiddling until it clicks. Each time you go through the hard, painful work of agonizing over writing that isn’t working and eventually get it to click, you become a better writer.</p>
<p>3) Read a lot. It’s like fertilizer.</p>
<p>4) On one side of the spectrum, you’re completely copying the exact style and even the wording of another writer you like—let’s call that a 1. On the other side, you’re completely unique, writing in a way the world has never seen before—let’s call it a 10. Your goal is to start somewhere in the middle and then work your way up the scale as you mature as a writer. That said, having influences is inevitable and perfectly okay, because true 10s don’t exist. This same concept applies to stand-up comedy, music, or any other type of art. It’s a badge of honor to say The Beatles are one of your influences, but no one likes a songwriter who’s blatantly copying The Beatles. Without getting to a 7 or 8 on the uniqueness spectrum, there’s likely a ceiling on how high your writing career can go.</p>
<p>5) While you’re experimenting with your writing, keep your mind open to all creative possibilities. The first 290 of the 300 blog posts I wrote in my 20s had no visuals. Only towards the very end did I try drawing something one night. And only then did I realize how much I liked combining hand-drawn visuals with my writing. That could have easily never happened, and if it hadn’t, Wait But Why would be an all-text blog today.</p>
<p>6) If you get feedback as you grow as a writer, be careful who it’s coming from. The person giving feedback should A) believe in you, B) be rooting for you, and C) be completely aware that what they’re reading isn&#8217;t your max potential but you experimenting, gaining confidence, and trying to figure out your voice. A person who satisfies all of those is great to get feedback from. Someone who fails any of those criteria is going to do you more harm than good, and will often be the person who makes you quit prematurely and never try again (even if you don’t realize they’re the reason that happened).</p>
<p>7) Remember that in most cases, the ideas behind the writing are more important than the quality of the writing itself. You’d rather have great ideas and pretty good writing than the other way around.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do you speak any other languages?</span> </strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>– Ricardo K. (Vinhedo, Brazil)</em></span></p>
<p>I speak 1.43 languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>40% of Spanish</li>
<li>1% of French</li>
<li>0.1% of about 20 other languages because I learned how to say a few sentences when I visited a country where that was the language</li>
</ul>
<p>My .4 Spanish capabilities are super useful when I visit Spanish-speaking countries, but mostly when I need to say something to someone. Once I finish, the party’s over. For some reason, my brain decided to not ever learn to understand what the fuck anyone is saying when they speak Spanish to me.</p>
<p>My problem is that I never learned Spanish well enough to do that thing where you have a Spanish part of your brain. So instead, I’ve memorized a ton of Spanish words and when I speak to someone, I’m doing what people who are bad at languages do—I’m rapid-fire translating in my head with each word that comes out of my mouth. I’m proficient enough to get around a Spanish-speaking country and even have conversations with people—as long as they don’t say anything back. When they do, it’s like someone throwing five tennis balls at me every second and expecting me to somehow catch all of them. So I go into a panic and just keep saying “lentamente” until their pace comes down so far that I can figure out what they’re saying.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How many people have ever lived? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I have a question I figured only WBW could answer properly. </strong><strong>It came up when I took a shower and I thought: &#8220;Wow, it&#8217;s kinda crazy that most people from the beginning of time till now haven&#8217;t felt the pressure of a hot shower,&#8221; since I guess that showers as we know it were invented only a couple of centuries ago (hot bath doesn&#8217;t count). </strong><strong>But then I thought&#8230; Is it true? There are approximately 7.4 billion people in the world today, and I think the numbers got that big only recently.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>This made me ponder: how many people have lived on Earth since the beginning of humanity? What percentage of them lived in the last 200 years? </strong>–<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> Zohar A. (Tel Aviv, Israel)</em></span></p>
<p>I’ve thought about the shower thing before. It’s incredible. Imagine being stranded on an island with only basic tools and trying to create an extended hot shower for yourself. Not gonna happen. A hot shower requires a ton of technology. In the interest of not spending two hours reading enough about the history of showers to be able to piece together an estimate for the number of people who have ever had access to a hot shower, I’ll leave it at that thought for now—though I’d be delighted if a reader would like to figure this out and put it in the comments.</p>

<p>Of course, Haub’s or anyone else’s estimate for this is imprecise and up for debate, especially since people aren’t even in agreement about when humans “started”. Either way, the fact that around 1/15 of all people who have ever lived are currently alive struck me as very high, considering that the past century accounts for at most 1/500 of the <em>time </em>humans have been around.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="http://www.prb.org/pdf/PT_novdec02.pdf" target="_blank">article</a>, Haub estimates that about 40% of those who have ever lived died before their first birthday and estimates that &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy_at_birth" target="_blank">life expectancy at birth</a> probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history.&#8221; If he’s right, it would mean that 1/10 of all humans age 1 or older who have ever lived are currently alive, and that fraction would become higher and higher as you increase the age. So maybe 1/5 of all 30+ year olds who have ever lived are currently alive and maybe a third of people who ever lived to 60 are still alive. And I’d bet that the <em>majority</em> of people 90 or over who have ever lived are alive right now. All guesses, but it seems logical.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What do you think about this picture?</strong></span><br />
<strong>I&#8217;ve been having a social issue over a photo of puppies I found on the Internet. Yes, a photo of puppies. I was bored (and admittedly in the dark playground), so I decided to search &#8220;adorable dogs&#8221; on Google images. I found the picture and was immediately in love. So, I decided to save it and show my family. I was taken aback when they reacted with disgust. My sister seems to think they look like &#8220;ugly pigs&#8221; and my mother has mentioned that they are too fat to be cute. It&#8217;s become a pretty heated debate. You seem to have good judgement, so if you have time, tell me what you think. </strong>–<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <em>Abigail </em><em>S. (Hartford, CT)</em></span></p>

<p>Fuckin shit, Abigail. This is literally what would happen if a human and a dog could breed. And in trying to figure out my thoughts on what you’ve presented to me, I’ve stared at it so long—especially the dog on the right—that I now have no idea what these creatures are. Also, I can only picture them having the same texture and consistency as a Stretch Armstrong toy if you pressed into their flesh. Like I’m picturing their skin being frictiony and rubbery, not anything like a biological creature. I&#8217;ve gone through a lot in the last few minutes—too much to really answer your question. If I had to answer, I&#8217;d say affection is closer to what I&#8217;m feeling than disgust, so I guess I agree with you.</p>
<p>And with that, let&#8217;s call it a day.</p>
