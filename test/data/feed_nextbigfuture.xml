    <description><![CDATA[<p>A WeChat public account of an official Chinese media said there is a new aircraft carrier that has been built on the berth. This is being interpreted as official confirmation that China is building a third aircraft carrier. China&#8217;s third aircraft carrier will have nearly double the displacement of the Liaoning aircraft carrier. The third carrier may reach 80,000 tons and should have electromagnetic catapult launching of jets. This would be far closer to the 100,000 to 107,000 tons of the US Gerald Ford super-carrier and Nimitz carrier. An 80,000-ton aircraft carrier would be larger than the 72,000 ton Queen </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#8217;s InSight Mars lander has successfully landed on Mars. InSight’s two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed. It is on the Mars&#8217; equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia. InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight&#8217;s instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight&#8217;s 5.9-foot-long </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The European Space Agency has released timelapse video of the Russian Progress MS-10 cargo spacecraft launched from Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. The video was taken by ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst from the International Space Station. The spacecraft was launched atop a Soyuz rocket with 2564 kg of cargo and supplies. Flying at 28 800 km/h, 400 km high, the International Space Station requires regular supplies from Earth such as this Progress launch. Spacecraft are launched after the Space Station flies overhead so they catch up with the orbital outpost to dock, in this case two days later on 18 November 2018. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>GM, Ford and other car makers are making big moves to prepare for a future dominated by self-driving cars, ride-sharing and electric cars. The next few years in the USA are still mainly SUV and Trucks. US light truck sales in 2018 were up 8%, passenger car sales were down 20% and overall light vehicle sales were slightly down. In 2019 or 2020, the World will make over 100 million light cars and trucks. General Motors will close three assembly plants by the end of 2019, and lay off up to 5,600 workers. The plants that are closing were all </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The success of SpaceX Falcon Heavy on its first launch was not just luck. Although this will be confirmed in 2019 and 2020 based upon what happens with about five planned Falcon Heavy launches. Before the Falcon Heavy flight Musk predicted a 50 percent to 70 percent chance of success because of concerns over the difficulty predicting how the vehicle would respond to extreme aerodynamic stresses and vibrations from the clustered engines. SpaceX has a 96.88% launch success rate (62 out of 64) with the Falcon 9. This launch success is with five major design changes for the Falcon 9 </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Researchers from the CNRS and Université de Sherbrooke, have discovered a universal law for the electronic properties of high-temperature superconductors. They exposed superconductors to an intense magnetic field to weaken superconductivity and reveal underlying properties. They measured the variations of electrical resistivity up to -263 °C, and developed a predictive model that can be applied to multiple families of high-temperature superconductors. This energy dissipation speed limit is linked to the numerical value of Planck’s constant, the fundamental quantity of quantum mechanics representing the smallest possible action that can be taken in nature. Natalie Wolchover writing at the Atlantic describes how </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The brain is the black box of the body: full of secrets and often inaccessible. Recently, though, medical and technical advances have enabled scientists to explore a variety of new modeling techniques and allowed them to see the brain as never before. New brain models may offer insight into the biology of brain cancer, enhance surgical planning, and help us understand better how the brain performs a variety of functions. They are also the first steps toward new interventions and improved quality of life for thousands of people. Cellular Scaffolds One of the best and most advanced approaches for modeling </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Brown University estimates the US Wars on Terror will be $5.9 trillion through 2019. This includes direct war and war-related spending and obligations for future spending on post 9/11 war veterans. US war spending will continue to grow. The Pentagon currently projects $80 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending through FY2023. Even if the wars are ended by 2023, the US would still be on track to spend an additional $808 billion to total at least $6.7 trillion, not including future interest costs. The costs of war will likely be greater than this because the number of veterans will </p>
